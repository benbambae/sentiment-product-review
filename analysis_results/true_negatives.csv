4,"The 3 T-Shirts we ordered were not as pictured and were smaller than the size guide.  We did, however, receive a refund less shipping costs after many phone calls to the seller and amazon.  The seller does not promtly return phone calls"
33,"These shoes look great on, however are extremely uncomfortable.  They run VERY small in size (I went up 1 1/2 sizes from what I normally wear in SM brand).  

I would not recommend them as shoes you would wear for more than an hour at a time because the thong portion cuts into your skin and the arches in the heels are so high that they put alot of pressure on the ball of your foot"
34,"For the money I spent on this bra it should be a better bra all around.  It gives a classic ""torpedo"" shape to the breasts, does not offer any lift, and is pretty much unwearable."
37,I bought this thinking for the price and name of item(Hardside)that I would receive something solid. What arrived was a disappointment. The outside is anything but solid. Made out of something a little harder than common plastics. Sent back item and looked for something truly worthwhile from Samsonite
41,Even for $13 I expected some quality and got very little. The dye from the leather dyed my feet during a rain storm. The footpad was so rough it irritated the botton of my foot. The leather over the toe was so rough it irritated my toe. These were REALLY poor
43,I returned this bra to exchange for size the day after I received it in October.  It is now January and I have not yet received the replacement.  I have called several times but to no avail!  I can't give a good review of this product because I haven't actually gotten to wear the bra
57,"Oh My. It enhanced my rolls instead of hide them. It did not help having the bones sticking out above my butt, which was very noticeable. Not worth the money charged for it."
77,"I am in great shape.  However, I cannot get over that so many men's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension.  Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.  

The idea of ""Medium"" as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  My body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32"" waist.  Is that not ""Medium"" sized? 

I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.  

The draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.  

Also, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.

I wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like ""old men's"" underwear. That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry.

I am not a mean hearted kind of guy.  So, I am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again."
85,I ordered these based on the picture---a high cut brief. These are not the ones they sent me and now I have to pay to return them! Rip off!!! Zero stars
86,I would not buy this product again.  It hurts my heeles badly because it is so narrow at that end
89,"Thin, cheap fabric barely represents flannel. Additionally the waist has a button on the hip..Who puts a button for a pair of PJ pants on the hip? I returned them immediatly. Not worth the price at al"
115,"I bought some of these - I find they have a large seam on the right side which digs into my skin and is quite uncomfortable.  Other than that they are OK, but because of this I mostly wear these inside out"
130,This shoe is cut right underneath the ankle. Everytime you walk the edge of the shoe rubs into your ankle and causes extreme discomfort and blisters.
138,These body suits are awful! When I first saw them I was really relieved that I had found something that would be good for the summer months. I put them on my twins after a first wash and the velcro closure scraped up the insides of their delicate little legs! The suits were the appropriate size and were washed according to the label. I am so disappointed and angry. It was a waste of my money.
143,My husaband had them for only a month before they came unsewn at the toes. Not a small hole but it went all the way across. And in both shoes. Not put together right. Very disappointed. To much money to fall apart!!!!!!!
148,"On Sept 17 I ordered a cashmere wrap. I finally got the company's attention when I placed a negative review on this forum. I was told if I removed the review after recieving the item, I would be credited for shipping. The item arrived Oct 16. As of today, November 20, my credit card had not been credited. I emailed the company and was told the credit should appear in four to five days."
149,"I purchased two scarves and in the first washing the thread in the hems unraveled, producing a ragged fringe all around.  These bandanas are thin, flimsy, and not worth the time or money"
157,"I washed 'em and they shrunk up so small I can't wear 'em anymore, bummer"
192,"The robe does not fit me. I wanted to return it, got a return item number, got busy, and did not get it in the mail soon enough. They have a strict 30 day return ploicy. Nordstroms does not do this. I could exchange it there.

Sorry I got a job and not time for petty rules. I will go elsewhere next time"
199,"I ordered this Dress on March 6th. I recevied an email from the company saying that it would ship by March 8th. On March 16th, I receive an email saying that they are out the size I wanted and my order has been canceled. This is unacceptable from a business. I should have been notified by March 9th that the dress had not been shipped. I have less than 24 hours to find a replacement dress. Thanks alot"
200,These shoes were not put together very well. The bottom of the heal part broke of and was bending inward from the second I put them on. If I had the choice to buy this breand again I would not. These shoes were very over priced and not put together well at all. I am very disappionted
208,"So I just got my shoes after waiting two long weeks....what a dissapointment. I open the box and immediately I see what appears to be a defect. The inside of the shoe (like on your right foot, the left side, not the right) was covered in little black dots that were smudged all over the grey area, including smudging on the asics logo. This was obviously a manufacturing defect seein it was the same color as the logo which was also smudged. Also, the shoe glue was leaking out the back of the shoe. Poorly done, last time I will ever buy ASICS shoes again"
215,"My son picked out these shoes for basketball. He liked them at first and gave them time to get broke-in, but the outsides of the shoes had no give. Most shoe will form to your foot, these did not. At the end of third stripe, you could feel a big ridge on the inside of the shoe.We had to buy a different pair of shoes that formed to his foot better. Nice looking shoe, but not the greatest fit"
221,"Mail Fraud,I believe its called!! texas shirt company if this is a real company never had this item to sell. I'm surprise Amazon.com is even associating with them..and mike to get this bent out of shape over a $12 dollar item you need to see someone to address your anger issues."
224,"Suit was too small, not enough information available on the site for it and I would not buy another bathing suit from Amazon as it cost me money to send it back."
241,"Extremely poor quality cloth. Very bad color. It looks used .
Never ever buy any items from this vendo"
242,..all over the neighbourhood.  now we're getting divorced and it's all YOUR FAULT Male Power Sheer Bong Thong!  i hate you
271,"I've had this coin purse not even 2 months now, and I've only used it about 7 times.  Unfortunately, the ZIPPER broke already! I couldn't believe it."
279,"I ordered these items in mid June, and my credit card was billed on June 22.  However I discovered two weeks later that, despite your having billed my credit card for items being purchased from Andrew Christian, the order had never been sent to them.  I was then assured that the order would be completed promptly (I told them I needed the clothing by July 19, otherwise I would not need the items at all)).  The order was not given to UPS until July 17 with an expected delivery date of July 21. Consequently I directed UPS to return the order unopened.  The handling of the entire mess was slopppy, and the billing of my credit card two weeks before the order was even placed was unethical and shameful."
286,It was very kind of the company to refund the items when i had to send them back. But the quality of the shirts where not the quality i am used to have when i buy orginal Van Heusen shirts
288,These bras offer zero support.  They would be good for someone who is young and firm enough to not need it:
289,When I ordered this skort the description didn't say that it was a childs size.  So I complained to the site that I bought it from.  I asked that my shipping also be returned because they didn't specify that this was a childs size.  I wasted my money on shipping for an item I wouldn't have ordered if I had known it wasn't an adult sized item.  They didn't return my shipping
290,"Bah, this skirt looks weird and cheap. It is not sewn on the bottom, just cut."
317,"These pants were washed one time, following the washing instructions, they were not put in the dryer, and they shrunk not only around, but lengthwise.  I had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and didn't have any problems.  I look forward to your reply"
318,"I purchased this item thinking that it would make a nice gift, but upon receiving it found it looks and feels like something from a dollar store, and it's not even worth the dollar.  
  Very cheezy item."
319,I bought these slippers as a present for my husband for Christmas. I can't return them  because he wore them for a day. These slippers were so badly made that he is wearing his old slippers. The shape of the sole on the right foot is the same as the left. Don't waste your money
322,"I bought these slippers for my husband at Christmas time.  I thought if I 
spent $50 on slippers they would last a long time, and be made very well.
I was wrong.  The slippers look good, and the upper leather is very nice
but the sole is a cheap, thin foam.  If you bend it, it snaps.  You would 
expect to find this on a cheap, $2 flip flop.  I was very disappointed.  I bought my husband a cheap $2 pair of suede slippers in Walmart that were just as nice with a thick rubber sole."
331,"i don't know why but it is an ugly dress. it doesn't look like the pic. maybe it's my shape (i have wide angular, shoulders) but it is very high on the chest which made me look a little granny-like"
340,"I bought this from Motherhood and hated it!!! It is too narrow and so puts a lot of pressure on your hips and pelvic bones, which any pregnant lady knows- our bones are already moving and don't need more help!! The mother ez belt was fabulous though!! I wore it for the last 4 months!!!  Forget about this one though!!!"
341,"For starters, this shirt is not a lighter, royal blue like it is pictured....it is a very dark, navy blue.  Very dark.  Also, the sizes run big.  Every t-shirt i own is a size Large.....this shirt is a size large, but is WAY too big. Be warned"
343,"I bought this dress for a trip I'm taking in one week. Should've known better. You get what you pay for, that's for sure. This dress arrived balled up in a USPS bag. It didn't look anything like the picture shown on this site, more like a slip, than a slip dress. And here's the kicker - it was RIPPED! Had two large ""snags"" on the back of the dress. I'm sending it back and they BETTER not try to charge me shipping. I'm PO'd to the max and who knows if I'll find a dress in time. Grrrr"
346,Poor fit for 80gb...stick on film to protect video face is a joke...it's cheap but save your money on this and buy something better
351,The boots were not what I expected.  The pictures made the books look different then they actually were.  They were exremely wide and the sizing was off.
363,"they were not as heavy weight as stated..to me they seem more like a regular t-shirt..and the size seems to be a little smaller than norm..after first washing, they really shrink..
I will not buy any more."
370,"I wouldn't wear these socks for two reasons:

1.  They have a red stripe at the toe and I wanted to wear them with sandals.

2.  They have their brandname emblazoned in red on the side, also ridiculous looking with sandals."
372,"I just found out that this shirt back-ordered after I was promised by Amazon BEFORE I ordered it that I will receive this item before December 23. I just now received notification that this item was shipped on the 24th, and I had purchased it on the 15th. This means I will not get it until after December 26th!

Because I bought this shirt to go with some camo pants for my sister, I was only able to give her pants without the shirt for Christmas. She had to leave back across country, and I am forced to send this shirt to her. How embarressing! Obviously it is Christmas time and if you're going to have a storefront on Amazon.com, you better get extra stock! The worse way to keep a happy customer is by backordering on Christmas and ruining a family member's present. Beware folks, you may not get this item when it says you will"
378,"I have to say I am rather disappointed with this item. Considering its price, I was expecting a firm control garment. It's not that it isn't well constructed and it is very comfortable, but it isn't anything approaching what I would call 'firm-control'. I don't think it would qualify for the title 'moderate-control'either. Much too expensive for what is essentially a light control briefer"
387,"I had got these for my husband for christmas. Nice material, however they were too tapered at the ankle and also short for him and he is average height, so we had to return it"
388,"I had got these for my husband for christmas. Nice material, however they were too tapered at the ankle and also short for him and he is average height, so we had to return it"
399,"Uncomfortable! Poor quality! Bad Customer Service! Nice box/advertising!
I purchased 3 of these (different colors), never having owned this brand.   I purchased from another online retailer, not Amazon.  One had a tag that read ""Medium"" which didn't match the size on the box or the size ordered, which was ""Large"".  Upon calling the online retailer all of their stock in the color ""gray"" was the same situation.  Returned it and received a replacement pair, size ""Large"", which was significantly bigger than either of the other 2 pair which were supposed to be size ""Large"".  I called C-in2 to express my dissatisfaction with the initial stock mix-up of all gray pair, received no response. 
Lastly, the ""sling"" advertised, sounds better in theory than it is.  After a couple of minutes the sling gets uncomfortable, feels like a paper cut"
422,"I really wanted to love this bra. Finding bras that are supportive when your full figured is difficult, not to mention expensive.  I was fitted for this bra before I bought it, but the store didn't have my size so I started looking for the bra online.  I ordered exactly the size that I was fitted for, received my two bras, and the fit was terrible. The bra is too tight, and the cups don't fit.  I'm not spilling out over the sides of the bra, usually the first indicator that the bra doesn't fit, there's all this extra material in the center of the cup.  
Aside from my fitting problems there are two other problems with this bra I'd like to point out.  Being full figured there are two things necessary to support bigger chests.  First, a bra band that is wide and has four hooks on it, this bra does not have that.  Second, you need wide, supportive straps, again this bra does not have wide enough straps. There are better bras out there."
425,"Shoe has a high back that kinda cuts in to your heel.  I love Clark's, but not this pair"
440,I was disappointed when I got the shoes and one of them was made with inferior suede and very thin.I emailed the company I bought them from and requested an exchange/return many times. They never responded and I ended up keeping the shoes as I needed them for work. I would not purchase from this company again.
457,"First time I've ordered a product from Leg Avenue - and it'll probably be my last!  I opened up the package and the pantyhose already had 4 ""runs"" in one of the legs before I even tried them on.  What a waste of money...and if I would pay to ship them back for another pair then I've already put way too much money into, what should be, an inexpensive product"
458,We were disappointed when we received this because it showed up in a search with silk robes and pajamas and I guess I assumed tht it was silk.  Rather stiff and uncomfortable
486,"I am not happy with what I got in the mail today. I thought I was getting a real used fencing foil. Instead, I got a kids plastic fencing sword!

Sending it back ASAP to get my account credited for sure!

Why is a real sword picture used to sell a kids fencing foil"
490,"This visor is square in shape instead of oval, I have never seen a square visor before. It looks very strange.  Also, it is not comfortable as it is supposed to be, it is uncomfortable at the location where the sides hug to my head.  I will not be wearing mine"
499,I was very disappointed with the pair of shoes that arrived. They appear used and have a small stain on them. As a result I will not be wearing them or ordering shoes online again. Lesson learned
505,"I just received my wallet today and must say that I am very disappointed.
First of all, it doesn't have enough compartments.  It might be ok for someone who only carries an ID and 4 additional cards and nothing else. The card slots are very tight and not made to fit more than one card in the same slot.  There is no spare key holder and no storage behind the ID card window.  The fabric inside the billfold is so thin you can see right through it.  This wallet is cheaply made, unlike the Fossil I currently own, which has held up for over 5 years.  What a waste of an Amazon.com gift certificate"
508,"1. Packaging was shabby.
2. The finishing was pathetic with threads hanging out.
3. The quality and feel of the cloth was the worst I have ever seen.
4. DONT be deceived by the pictures.
5. The end product is not worth a gift or personal use nor 25% of the actual cost"
515,i didn't like the material of this skirt especially the black and white one i don't like it it's feels it's for old ladies
533,It reminds me of a cheap imitation patch that my grandmother would sow onto a hat. I have several MLB hats and this isn't anywhere near the same quality
537,"The item looks cheap. I ordered a medium size but it was 2X bigger than the regular size. ""Ugly"
538,"Pretty thin, not well made, will not last long.  Other than that I really liked the"
555,"I purchased these sandals thinking they would be comfortable
and because they looked like they were made of leather.
They are more like a vinyl material and are stiff and not
attractive.  They will be returned."
617,"i never recieved the product.
the order was cancelled by the sende"
641,"I ordered 4 toddler long-sleeved tees' in the same size, I thought.  When I received the shipment, all 4 tees' were different sizes [even though they were all labeled the same size].  I have returned the items since the tees' run two sizes too small, and the workmanship is questionable, which translates into...that I will not be able to give this item to my loved one for Christmas."
642,"These were a gift at Christmas, and were a deep burgundy color. they do appear to be well stitched. however, after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading, and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don't look like a match anymore.  the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much!"
663,Never charged a thing.  I bought it to use on international travel. It stated that it could be used on 220 and it burnout out shortly after being plugged in
675,"I ordered this jacket in this size based on the sizing chart provided. When it arrived, it was not even close to the size as stated. I contacted customer service and was assured I would not be charged for shipping both ways. However, my refund notice arrived today and I was charged $10 for shipping. It would have been cheaper just to keep it and eBay it"
679,"IT IS A HORRIBLE ITEM.  IF I COULD HAVE GIVEN THIS HAIRAGAMI A NO STAR RATING, I WOULD HAVE, AND TO THINK I WASTED ALMOST $20 FOR THIS JUNK. IT SNAPS UNEXPECTEDLY ALL THE TIME, AND ALWAYS WHILE YOU ARE TWIRLING THE HAIR.  IT TOTALLY TANGLES THE HAIR. IT IS A NIGHTMARE TO GET OUT OF YOUR CHILD'S HAIR.
MY OLDEST, 12, REALLY WANTED THIS HAIRAGAMI AND WAS TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED.
SHE TOLD ALL HER FRIENDS NOT TO BUY IT"
689,"These shoes are very comfortable, look great but I had a terrible problem with the ""ruggedness"" of these shoes.  I am an avid hiker and climber and bought these shoes for the reasons that Merrill is known for, ruggedness and great outdoor shoes.  After only owning these shoes for a month I noticed that the leather sides were cracking away from the sole.  This happened on both pairs of shoes and soon there was 2 holes in each pair.  The insides ripped from slipping them on and off.  I returned the pair to the store I bought them at and got a new pair.  The same problem happened.  These shoes are very cheap and very expensive.  Do not buy!  They look great but unless you are planning on displaying them only I would stay away from them"
699,"I am in great shape.  However, I cannot get over that so many men's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension.  Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.

714,"The shoes seems to be well put together for having never been worn, because the fit is horrible!  Why I thought buying shoes without trying them on fist [knowing my size and wearing Florsheims] is a mystery I will have to self-solve.  These are made in Korea [stamped right under the flap] on both pairs and the width is as wrong as the makers mark.
Stay away from these no matter what the price.  I took them to two shoe makers to have them stretched and they said if they tried, the seems would rip apart and the leather would crack.  Not a comforting thought since wearing them should naturally stretch them anyway."
723,"These booties are very cute and soft, but they just slip right off my son's feet.  They do not have a way to secure the 'tongue' part of the bootie when you cinch up the velcro and as soon as baby moves their feet, the 'tongue' part just pulls right out.  Not a good value for the money."
727,"These socks have an excess of thread bundled at the corners of the toe seams. If this sort of design bothers you (as it does me), then these are not the socks for you. These socks cause a lot of discomfort for me"
730,"Lookslike it would be a nice product, but it's only for very small babies up to 12 pounds and 23 inches. My baby is very long and just doesn't fit - wish Target/Amazon would have been more upfront with the sizing"
734,"The quality of this product cannot in any way compare to the genuine Apple iPod covers.  It is very flimsy, does not fit correctly, does not come with a belt clip and most importantly leaves the display area wide open to scratches and breakage.  That's right; there is no plastic or glass protection for the display area. 

There is a reason why this product does not cost as much as other iPod covers.  That's because it is of poor quality.  Also, when you calculate the cost of the cover, plus the cost of shipping it, you do not get a bargin.  As a matter of fact, if someone gave me this product for free, I would not accept it because, like I stated earlier, it provides no protection."
736,"I have done a review on these socks already, which has not appeared.  They are not a good buy"
740,"This is saled as a baseball shoes but it is for american footbal. But the mistake goes more long, because the photo included shows a baseball shoes how you can observ in the marks of the sole"
741,As soon as I put the case on it ripped! Then I contacted the seller and after a BIG hassle they sent me a different case. When the Case arrived it was already broken. Now I am stuck with 2 broken ipod cases. I would strongly recommend not buying from this store
745,"The Zen cover didn't work that good. I had to cut off one of the flaps that covers the ""buttons"" because it was not made right.  I ended up taking the cover off and don't even use it anymore. It's not worth getting"
758,TOO BAD THERE WASN'T A RATING OF 0 STAR. THIS IS THE WORST PIECE OF JUNK I EVER BOUGHT. FIRST OF ALL WE WERE LOOKING FOR A BRAND CALLED SPORTS AFIELD. THIS ITEM FELL UNDER IT WHEN WE DID A SEARCH. WHEN IT ARRIVED IT WAS SOME OFF THE WALL BRAND.THEY WERE PAPER THIN BUT  THOUGHT MAYBE THEY WERE WARM BEING IT WAS FROM AN ARMY AND NAVY STORE. WRONG!!!!!!! THEY SERVED NO PURPOSE AT ALL.WERE NOT WARM AT ALL. .WE WASHED THEM PER DIRECTIOS ON TAG AND SHRUNK SO BAD I DON'T THINK A 2 YR OLD COULD FIT IN THEM.DO NOT BUY!!!!!!JUN
759,This is a cheap and flimsy armband.  NOT THE ONE IN THE PICTURE.  There are much better on Amazon for less money
764,I bought these shoes about 2 months ago and they are already ruined.  The leather is so thin that it has separated and is peeling.
765,"I was not pleased with these.  I bought mine at Target, and within one month the soles of both sandals were cracked.  No refund, since they were used."
769,"These two packets of panties were too large.  I also didn't like the cotton.  Since I had opened one packet of three I kept it, but  I sent the unopened packet of 3 back because I didn't like them.
Jeanne Allen"
771,"I can't say much for the shoes, but Amazon goofed up on this one.  They shipped out an empty box.  Luckily UPS caught it and sent notice to Amazon for me."
780,"I was impressed by the look of this bag.  It really looked like it would seal the contents well.  Unfortunately, it did not.  I tried several times, and each time, the contents of the bag were soaked!
Fortunately I tested it out with just some cash for a day at the pool... and only ended up with soggy money.  If I had put my cell phone and watch in the bag, they would have been ruined.
I DON'T RECOMMEND IT"
788,"I don't own this gear bag, and I'm not going to buy it even though it looks interesting.  Would this be a suitable carry-on bag, or would I have to check it?  I don't know.  The dimensions are not given anywhere.  I want to know more about the products I order"
798,"This gown is well made, with no defects.  While some ladies may find the gown to their liking, the stretch lace material of the bodice was irritating to my skin and the ivory color was FAR more see-thru than I desired"
812,"It is advertised as a pant set,but it came as a capri set.It has a lacy thing around the neck that is extremely uncomfortable"
816,"Not worth the price at all...
The bead work looks very cheap...
The color does not look the way its shown in the picture.
Decided to return it the moment I opened the box.."
822,"This item came on time but the sizing are wrong.I normally wear medium and I bought large thinking the cheap price would affect sizing. I was right. Had to give them away,could not wear them.They were so tight and the fabric so light I could not think of wearing the"
825,"I purchased this expecting a high quality Satin robe, but what I received was a run of the mil polyester robe. Yes, it is shiny, but it feel like plastic.

Sadly, this will be returned"
828,This bag is very small. The zipper does not have the ability to separate - making the bag much smaller. I returned the bag - very disappointed
838,"The sizes listed do not print on the invoice.  Instead, Army Navy uses 'codes.'  When they send the wrong sizes, then they blame you for not selecting the right size and want a 15% restocking fee plus return shipping"
845,Not Happy at all with these slippers.  Do not buy them.  They lasted 3-4 week and then he inside was shot.
860,"I bought a sweatshirt from them--the tote was a ""freebie"" and too small for much use anyway.

Customer service was awful. They sent me the wrong size--a man's size, not the woman's I was searching for (and the photo had a woman wearing it!  She must have been an Amazon).  I returned it the next day and they REFUSED to accept the return, saying it looked worn"
864,I ordered these White Tank Tops and 3 colored Tank Tops.  I have never received these White Tank Tops and have requested a refund and requested another size they had in stock and have received neither.  I have sent emails requesting this and still no resolve
870,"I bought the 18-24 month old size for my 15 month old who is in the 90% of height and 40% of weight.  The sock felt soft and fit her foot perfectly. But the ankle elastic part was so tight it left a dark red mark within seconds of wearing. And our daughter does not have fat ankles! I wish the ankle wasn't constructed so tightly, but I now have 6 socks that will never be worn.."
872,"This is very cheaply made, from very poor quality fabric.

The styling is not good, and the fit is poor.It does not resemble the photgraph.

I would pay ( at most) $ 5.00 for this dress"
880,"We bought this for our teenage son.  The handling of the shipping was prompt, that is the only good thing I can say about the coat.  I will definately agree with a previous posting that the wool seems to be of very poor quality, almost felt-like. The item that looked not so great after taking it out of the box, looked terrible after only a week or so of my son wearing it to school!  I am almost ashamed to send him out of the house in the coat. If it was not so cold, I would tell him to go back to the sweatshirt he was wearing!  The item pills making it look really shabby.  No reports of seams ripped, buttons lost, or holes in the pocket, however, he may be worried that if he tells me about those things I will be upset with him because the coat was just a waste of money.  It was a major clothing item that he had picked out for himself, so imagine his disappointment!  I expected much more of the coat than I got,  and I am looking for a replacement"
881,Waited weeks and still waiting to date for a credit. Very unhappy with return policy.  Wondering if I'll ever get my credit
882,"Ok, for some reason my first review was never posted which only makes me more upset about this bra!  This bra is useless for me.  It has snaps instead of clasp which make it a two handed job to open and close, not so great for public nursing.  And, for someone who is a 34-36 B-C it is amazing to me when the bra slides out of place, the nursing pads fall out and my bed becomes soaked with middle of the night leakage!  All and all I would not recommend this bra"
883,"I was very dissapointed when I received these boots.  The description clearly states that the boots are leather, but they are NOT."
887,"So cheap, the seams weren't sewn up all the way.  Am returning"
891,"This camisole did not fit my purpose. The idea is great, but it didn't fit me correctl"
900,"While this product appears very nice in pictures and upon arrival, it does not function to transmit the IPOD via FM frequency.  It can hook to the IPOD, cradle the IOPD and charge the IPOD, but it does not transmit.  The product was made in China but has no other company information to search for techincal assistance or return.  While I could probably process back through Amazon and the seller, it is not worth my effort.

All in all -- a complete loss of cost and shipping for this product"
902,"The robe does not fit me. I wanted to return it, got a return item number, got busy, and did not get it in the mail soon enough. They have a strict 30 day return ploicy. Nordstroms does not do this. I could exchange it there.

Sorry I got a job and not time for petty rules. I will go elsewhere next time"
918,"These bootie/slippers are terrible.  They don't EVER stay on, there's no anti-skid on the bottom and are cheaply made.  I would give these 0 stars if I could, it was a complete waste of money- don't bother getting these regadless of how inexpensive they are"
929,"The sweatshirt has a cardboard feeling that does not conform to the body. My husband is 6' 178 pounds, so he does not have a problem finding clothes that fit, but this one looked like a stiff kite on him. 
BE AWARE The items were returned and the vendor took over five weeks after receiving the item back to refund the money, and only after I had filed a complaint with Amazon. Amazon acted quickly to post the credit."
935,"Thin cloth...aweful insulation factor,,,,does not look good on me.."
941,"I can't review this product, because I never got it! I emailed Amazon for a refund, since I was supposed to receive my order by Dec 22 and today Jan 17th I haven't receive it"
960,"The Sling Support feature on these underwear is practically useless. My testicles always slip completely out of the sling before I've had them on for even an hour. If these briefs enhance a man's ""profile"" at all, it's because they're so darn tight; it has nothing to do with the Sling Support. And talk about ""low-rise""--the top of my crack is exposed even when they're pulled all the way up.  I'm in pretty good shape, but if these things shrink in the dryer, I won't be able to fit into them anymore. My advice: anybody ordering C-IN² briefs should go one size larger than what he'd normally wear"
965,"I agree with ""MOLLIE"" from Ohio. I've also purchased the petite version of these same pants for years and after they came out with the newer version, I can longer wear them for all the same reasons she mentioned. They just don't fit right. Please Land's End go back to the old style. (chris's wife"
971,"I was unable to return the item because of restrictions imposed by their return policy

I made a mistake by buying i"
982,The nippits didn't really work for me and they were painful to remove
1023,"I received my new shoes this afternoon and took a test run. I didn't really buy this a3 for its ""functionality"" but rather the look. I thought the honey comb and the color combination look kinda cool. However, I DID NOT at all feel being ""propelled through every foot"", and the so called a3 cushion heels felt very stiff. I even poked it with my hand, oh man it's hard. I also tried jumping up and down to try to feel the bounciness, but all I did feel was my feet stomping hard onto the cement. 
BTW, if your feet are wide and flat like mine, it's going to be very uncomfortable when walking with these shoes.  

*** UPdate *** November 15, 2006
It's been 2 months since I've been wearing these shoes, and I've changed my opinion them. Once you get use to the a3 sequence, they are actually quite comfortable. The honeycombs under the heels do make every step a little bouncier now. Maybe it takes time to soften up the material and make them more flexible"
1058,A red star!?!?  I bet this won't sell well in eastern Europe.
1070,"I received this item as a gift and was disappointed when I pulled it out of the box. It's okay, but not as cute looking as the photo makes it seem. The beads on the hem and chest look nice in the photo, but are rather cheap looking. 
It looks like something I could make myself. Very cheap and plain looking."
1072,the swim suit was so unsatisfactory looking that I didn't even try it on.  it was blue striped with a totally different blue strap that didn't go with the main color of the suit.  Very poor choice for a grab bag.  Taught me not to use grab bag shopping from this company
1077,"This garment is poorly sewn with cloth which was too thin to provide some very necessary functions for men. If you just want underwear look on; however, if your aim is to obtain a bedroom brief you can do better for less. At is unless the view is everythin"
1125,"I really wanted these boots and had been contemplating getting them for almost 6 months.  When they came I was so excited and took them out of the box to look at them and they were stained.  I was extremely disappointed that the product was defective, because I have never had a problem with any Amazon products in the past, I sent it back and I was reimbursed for my purchase.  I am really disappointed I will think twice before I purchase any shoes from Amazon again"
1131,It looks great but the lace in the back itches so bad that I cannot wear it
1146,Very cheaply made - transparently thin weave - and much too small for an adult with a head larger than a grapefruit.  I returned it.  WAY overpriced even at $7.99.
1147,"I purchased this shirt for my golfer mom for Christmas and had to return it.  I bought an XL because she normally wears a 16, but the shirt was about the right size for me (an 8).  The quality seemed to be fine, but the sizing was very misleading"
1157,"These pants were washed one time, following the washing instructions, they were not put in the dryer, and they shrunk not only around, but lengthwise.  I had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and didn't have any problems.  I look forward to your reply"
1171,"I am vey unhappy with the sales professional in Nautica outlet stores. I had a very bad experience at Nautica store outlet stores. The customer service representatives are very rude and unprofessional. They basically said they don't really care if they lose one customer, other customers will  still buy. ( if that is the case, why are prices slashed by 50%...it is because people do not want to pay the full price ...)I do not think I will ever buy from Nautica. A few uncaring sales represtatives give a very bad name to the whole company"
1177,"I paid for expedited shipping, but my order took forever!  Communication with the company was unacceptable to say the least.  At first I received only half of my shipping refund and had to complain to Amazon and BestPriceCenter to get the rest.

There is NO way I would ever do business with this company again, and I would like to urge others to do likewise.  This is not personal, just bad business practice"
1178,This is a beautiful sandal but the shoe was made from really stiff and ungiving material.  The footbed was uncomfortable and not a good fit or feel to it.  The price is right but there are so many sandals with gemstones to choose from I decided to return these sandals
1180,"Item was called ""Fleese"" but was 80% cotton and looked & felt like a regular sweat shirt. To return an item to them, they give you free mailing, but they will deduct $5.95 off the refund for S&H. After calling them about this, they agreed to give us a full refund. But the refund will not show up until after 2 or 3 billing cycles. I doubt that makes many consumers happy. Champion makes a fine line of products, but I will never deal with them on line agai"
1181,This robe virtually fell apart when I washed it.  It stained the inside of my washing machine.  It raveled before I even got a chance to wear it.  Do not buy this product.  I got the burgandy one.  I am so disappointed by this product I may stop shopping at Amazon
1192,"I'm all about buying pretty things, but this pretty thing pretty much don't work the way you'd want.  While the iPod Nano is in the case, neither outlets on the bottom are accessible-- more importantly, the headset jack."
1211,"Poor design and fit, such that after 4-5 wears, the front of both shoes wore out - into a hole.  Not recommended"
1227,"I ordered the jacket pictured, but I received an entirely different Bernardo jacket.  Customer service re-ordered for me and I got the same incorrect jacket.  I wouldn't bother ordering this unless customer service assures you that their inventory glitch has been corrected"
1229,THe pants that I ordered for my size were very small. They weren't true to size at all. I would not recommend this item to anyone
1256,"I ordered a pair of the adult designer rain boots from Diane's Little Lambs. I specifically ordered because the boots appeared to accommodate a wider calf (were shorter, fuller, etc). But the boots that arrived were taller, even the color was not the same as 
on the website. I emailed the vendor, never got a reply. So I went to the website to get instructions on mailing the boots back."
1259,"The robe does not fit me. I wanted to return it, got a return item number, got busy, and did not get it in the mail soon enough. They have a strict 30 day return ploicy. Nordstroms does not do this. I could exchange it there.

Sorry I got a job and not time for petty rules. I will go elsewhere next time"
1260,This item was cancelled by Amazon because of a price mistake that they would not honor after taking my order.very poor customer servic
1280,"The color that I received and the color that was online was not the same.  I shipped it back.  Had to pay for the shipping and handling and insurance myself.  Tried to resolve through Hungry Lion, but they claimed the color was never shown online, when it was.  Hungry Lion did say I would get a refund on the item.  Still have not checked to see if I have received credit yet. Still waiting for my statement."
1282,"The boots are not how they seem in the picture. Yes they have real rabbit fur trim and yes, it has real sheep wool lining. However, the quality of the leather is very poor and not how it would appear in the photo. The leather is very dry and thin. I applied a leather oil which seemed to help a bit but I feel for nearly $100 I would have gotten a better quality product"
1304,"This is not a jockstrap.  It is a thong and is inappropriate for any sporting activity.  I tried wearing it as regular underwear but found it incredibly uncomfortable, let alone not exactly hygenic!  No surprise that they are phasing them out of their lineup.  Probably the only uncomfortable underwear made by RIPS"
1318,I am a 44DD I am having the hardest time finding a good bra...I ordered this one and I am a little dissapointed.  The underwires in the front poke out and make it look like I have these bones sticking straight out of my chest.  Everthing else is ok...no complaints other than the underwire not laying flush with my chest bone
1330,"The glasses look fine... from a far distance. They are produced very carelessly. Given that it's on sale, the quality can not be as high as normal. However, it should not that bad"
1349,"I purchased 5 of the Anvil SS Henleys in assorted colors not long ago.  Out of the box, they were good quality.  After 2 washes, however, they have shrunk drastically to the point that they cannot be tucked in anymore.  My personal opinion... waste of money"
1353,I ordered these for my 21 year old daughter who attends Juilliard.  They looked terrible because they were shiney.  The worst part is that the company will not allow a return or exhange.
1358,Coat was of VERY cheap quality. The fur around hood was matted. No way I would wear or recommend this coat.  It went staight to Good Will. I guess you get what you pay for.  Unless it is free you are paying too much
1361,"I still got a pantyline with this---strange and frustrating----
:"
1385,"I ordered the black one. According to the photo provided, it was supposed to be black with white seams, but when i received it, it was all black. Once I put it on it fitted perfectly. But it is simply too difficult to put on even though it is the right size."
1398,"The fabric of the bathrobe was wonderful Egyptian cotton, but the bathrobe was huge.  It was more like a tent than a bathrobe.  It was an anniversary present for my wife (size 8) and the bathrobe was one size fits all as long as you wear a size 18.  I was very disappointed that I could not have ordered at least a general size (large, medium or small)"
1400,"I paid for two tie racks. I received a large box with only only tie rack and a receipt for both. I figured that they would send the second later, but it never happened...

The one rack that I did receive looked fine"
1412,"I have seen others wear these slides and I know Adidas usually supplies an excellent product. I did read the other reviews that warned of a need for ""breaking in"" the sole nubs and wearing socks during that process. However, I've worn these slides for 2+ months and they still make the soles of my feet tender unless I continue to wear socks.  I am disappointed in the slide but I will stubbornly continue to wear them. Maybe some day they will be ""broken"""
1417,"You can use them as a ""skin"" but to use them excercising or on the move is no good.  The attachment to the strap is poor and the ipod is on a clip that can rotate so when you're moving it is swinging around and just not useful for anything other than standing still"
1421,"For all the costs involved in purchasing the Jedi Robe it was'nt worth it.
Shipping/handling and customs charge were not worth purchasing the item.  I will never shop Amazon or any online store"
1426,"I have been a 34 size for my entire life and this bra fits terrible...the fabric is stiff and so uncomfortable..I could not wait to take it off. Champion should stick to making sports bra...do not buy this bra or you will suffer. Plus, it looks much thinner in the picture..it is really thick...it feels like a maternity bra. UGH"
1439,"Ordered a pair...and they lost my first order.  Had to contact amazon to help. Finally got order..and pants were too small. So..had to RE order larger size.  Got pants in SAME size as last. Wrote back saying I know have TWO pair of pants that are too small.    
First they denied sending wrong size..then later wrote back saying they did make a mistate and that new order in correct size was on its way with postage lables to send pants back. Well a month later still have not recieved pants or lables.  Have wrote half a dozen emails asking for a reply and help..NO REPLY.  Never had such POOR customer service"
1447,The title says it all.  This product does not offer much in the way of control and it is definitely not firm.  Basically you are spending $35 for a high waist brief
1449,"I Purchased this to replace my husband's favorite keyfob from American Eagle, which was almost identical (and lasted ten years, incidentally). This one fell apart after two months. Time for a trip to the local leathersmith.."
1469,"I got it a few weeks ago. Although the light turned on in the charger (indicating the electrical socket is good), my shuffle only briefly flickered its charging/LED light.   I played around with it, but it seems it can't maintain contact and charge despite many attempts over several days.  I gave up and simply use my usb charger (with the stable base) hooked up to my laptop"
1472,"Suit was too small, not enough information available on the site for it. I called Amazon, but even the customer representative was not sure the size. I bought the suit as he suggested, but it is too small"
1474,These pants have a tendency to split horizontally for almost no reason at all. If they split alont the seam that would be one thing but to ctross a seam and just practically explode even when they fit loosely can only mean rotten fabric and that is what you will get when you buy these. I have lost the 3 pairs I biught to the self same calamity and always in public. Please save yourself the trouble. By the way the Lee version of these pants also do the same thing. Be afraid be very afraid.
