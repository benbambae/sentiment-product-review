0,I love this bag!  The quality of the canvas and stitching is wonderful.  I would have expected to pay a lot more for this bag. The orange is a great color
1,Great product at a great price!!  Fast shipping too!
2,I've had two of these and they are great. Truly no headache! I'm here to buy a third
3,My son loved these shoes. Even though he is two all he could say was CARS
5,"After years of wanting some overalls my wife got me a pair for my 35th birthday. She says I now look like the 5-yr inside of them.

But what are the two extra buttonholes in the bib pockets for? I figure one of them is for a pen or pencil, but I can't figure out what the other is for.

They are comfy, spacious, and have plenty of pocket room for tools and nails, nut and bolts. A must have for any man, though they are much sexier on women"
6,"This is my second Rider sandal.  They have a confortable feel, padded sole for cushion and are reasonably durable.  My last pair made it for about 6 years of pretty active use.  With my bad heels, the cushioned stride is great.  And I've never found a more comfortable and customizeable fit in a sandal"
7,Both chargers and the A/V cable work well and are great to have on hand for charging my video ipod because watching video on it drains the power quicker than just audio
8,"These shorts are awesome.  They fit perfectly, they keep me totally covered, but they're short enough that I stay cool.  They're rad.  I will be ordering more pairs soon"
9,"Holds up well in rain, very roomy.  Padded straps keep shoulders comfortable when bag is heavy.  Very happy with product"
11,I simply loved this wallet. And it came in a cool package. beautiful butter soft leather. supple and smellin' great
12,"Slippers are nice and comfortable, but I should caution that they run slightly small. I'm a 9.5 and the large size is snug for me"
13,"Comfortable, stylish, elegant and very sexy.  Also washes well and keeps its good looks.  The fabric feels wonderful against the skin"
14,These are the best thing to happen to laces. They actually hold a knot without making a double knot. Now if only they came in more colors..
15,These were great - arrived in a timely fashion and were just like they were shown to be on the site
16,I like the design simplicity of this shoe but don't use it for jogging or running as you will feel uncomfortable. I guess it is made for walking
17,"I purchased these crew neck tops after being unhappy with various brands of ""waffle"" thermal shirts.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the Duofold Insulayer tops to be almost silky smooth, lightweight, and very warm.  I wore them recently under by suit while back in New York and Chicago during their ""NorEaster of 2007"" and found them to be the perfect undergarment for business wear in harsh cold.  I give them a big ""Thumbs Up"""
18,"IT IS MY MAIN BAG NOW, EVERYTHING FITS INTO THAT I NEED TO TAKE ON TRIPS TO THE BEACH. THE STRAPS ARE STRONG, AND EASY TO CARRY"
19,"Of the Love Fifi items my husband recently bestowed upon me, this was the third item I had tried on.

My other-half had selected the Black & Red version for me (the one pictured) -- which made it easily one of the most romantic of the bunch!

After a nice dinner out and once we got home -- I told my husband that I wanted to change into something more ""comfortable.""

When he came into the bedroom, I had slipped on these Jezebel crotchless panties along with my sexiest black negligee.  I was also sprawled across the bed - with the most alluring come-hither look I could muster.  (Hey, don't laugh!  It still works!)

I wasn't sure if lightning would strike again.  Buy hey!  With these Love Fifi's centerless panties -- I'm definitely three-for-three!


For some reason, I had assumed that these (and other) crotchless knickers would have little appeal between women.  

But when a close girlfriend came to visit one weekend - I soon learned otherwise!

I hopped under the sheets - with these Jezebels on, unbeknownst to her - to help warm her bed.

After getting reacquainted -- she playfully tried to slip her hand underneath - but I kept shooing it away!  

This went on for about ten minutes, until it finally dawned on her - that there was another way in!  

This was, incidentally, about ten minutes LONGER than my husband - or any guy, for that matter - would've taken to figure it out!

Surprisingly, I never would've guessed - that these Love Fifi crotchless undies would be so versatile!  Everyone loves `em!"
20,"I'm a nurse.  I wear one of these everyday at the hospital.  If you're looking for comfort, this bra is it"
21,"The most comfortable slippers I've ever worn.  I'm not kidding, Perfect for staying at home or wearing at school.  Get them"
22,"hello'
this item it's on of the best watch from guess it's nice and i advice you to buy i"
23,"the shop did a wonderful job shipping my items right away - i had no problems, both items fit great, and the scarf i ordered is so versatile!
also, the prices were amazing.
thanks"
24,Received these shoes extremely fast.  The shoes fit perfectly and were in excellent condition.  I have four pair of these shoes in different colors because of their comfort and price.  I have had excellent service from Bealls
25,"This is a nice shirt, not as warm as we had hoped though. The lining is quite thin. It washes fairly well, loses a bit of its shape but not a lot. A great shirt for the fall. Its roomy & comfortable"
26,"I love these Crocs!  They are much more comfortable than the original style, and I like the two tone color combo.  I wear them even in the winter"
27,"I was able to get a great pair of pants for really cheap, enough said"
28,The leather is super soft. There is more than enough room yet it's not bulky. Top quality for less than a couple trips to that fast food place. I've had more wallets than I can count and this one tops everything. You'll also get some free stuff in the box that makes it all the more cool. Thanks Fossil
29,"I've had this briefcase for about a month now. It's held up perfectly so far. The closure mechanisms are not buckles, but clips behind the buckles. It's been roomy enough to put a palm pilot, pens, and multiple files with papers. The leather looks great and it's very light. The shoulder strap is also comfortable. Assuming it contiues to hold up for a reasonable length of time, I'd buy this product again. One note: If you are looking to store a laptop in this briefcase, I'd think twice. It's not as large as most laptop briefcases and definately does not have adequate padding in my opinion. But for carrying documents, books and other items, it has met all my expectations"
30,I bought these pants recently and I notice that I do more laundry so that I'll be able to wear THESE pants to as many yoga classes as possible. They are awesome
31,"I was so impressed with this shirt that I had to buy another for my best friend!  It is for her birthday, so I have yet to see her expression!  But since I thought it was awesome, I knew she would love it too.  We are both on different bowling leagues and so far, everyone else got a kick out of it.  My opinion, this is where we should get a good team together and order from CruisinUSA.  I wouldn't mind being a Gutter Gal, so to speak!  These shirts are AWESOME!  I give BowlingShirts.com 10 stars!!  Bravo!"
32,"What an absolute winner! THIS IS A CLASSIC AND I MEAN CLASSIC! It accentuates all the good and covers all the bad. Very retro styling with leg and bottom coverage that leaves you feeling modestly but elegantly comfortable. Made out of substantial fabric in a updated modern black with gold design. The bodice support is remarkable too, it has stays at the sides to give bra like support. However it's the hip and bottom support that makes this suit unique. It's basically a 40's style suit with a modern twist. The price is awesome too. A swim suit of this quality would usually be around $100.00 or more. I am a happy old lady customer! I swim a lot. I buy a lot of suits and there are only three brands that are any good...Maxine, Lands End, and Carol Wior."
35,"nice burgandy-ish color, leather is sturdy, yet comfortable.
Cute style, slightly larger heel than Clarks usually has. Also, gives a bit of o squeak the first few times u wear them
Overall nice shoe, should be durable too"
36,The first pair that I got didn't fit and they were the wrong color.  I sent them back and had the correct one within days.  Perfect service and great product.  Thank you!  They made my 5 year old's day
38,"I was hesistant as a first time buyer of a product like this, but I was very pleased with the ease of the transaction, the prompt arrival of the correct product and the quality of the product.  It was exactly what I had wanted and my son was thrilled"
39,"This is my favorite bra!! I bought one and I loved it so much I got another one.  It is very supportive, yet comfortable and looks great even under fitted sweaters."
40,"Very well made(USA). These socks are heavyweight,good for winter.Very generous sizing.Good fit. I like them"
42,The jersey arrived very quickly and was perfect. I was very satisfied with Amazon :
44,This is a perfect bra for a younger average body type.  It gives an uplift and no show through.  I will purchase this product again.  Made much better than other bras as well
45,"I have a just-turned 12 yr old girl with a rather large foot (size 10 women's) and these look cute and are comfy for her without having the typical heel that I usually can only find in her size.  I bought her the silver ones and they fit comfortably (although they say here they run small, they fit her okay in her regular size)  I cannot attest to the durability of them yet because she just got them, but I think overall because it is the Skechers good reputation and that they were an excellent price, that we made a good deal"
46,"This is the great suitcase.  I have never owned one like it.  And the yellow definiatly stands out at the airport, I can find my luggage fas"
47,They were an excellent price and a great quality. It was everything I wanted in a robe.
48,"I love my Cayman Crocs. My sister swore by these shoes, but I wasn't convinced because they are a little different looking. I liked the bright colors I saw some people wearing at the beach this summer, but I'm practical and they can only go with so many things. 
I ended up purchasing a navy pair because they go with just about anything. I'm not at all disappointed. They really don't look bad paired with casual outfits. 
I wish they could make the soles of all shoes out of this stuff though because it's amazing. It's not so much that you slip them on and say ""wow this feels great"" ... for me it was more so that after activities (marathon shopping trips for example) my feet weren't sore or tired when my regular shoes would have had them ready to quit. I think they are great ... even with the ""different"" look ... though I do wish they'd come up with a more stylish pair at some point"
49,"This is a very comfortable jockstrap that's perfect for jogging as well as normal everyday wear.  I've worn it as regular underwear and found that the comfort level & support is excellent.  Normally I like to wear the Jockey Next-to-Nothing thongs, but need more ball support when I'm jogging on the treadmill.  The front pouch conforms to your bulge perfectly and has the right amount of fabric to completely cover & cup your balls, unlike other thongs and jocks on the market that leave some uncovered space.

I love the textured look and feel of the ribbed mesh pouch while the support is consistent and comfortable.  The thin colored waistband offers a great look when compared to the excessively wide waistbands of other jocks.  The straps that go around your cheeks give you the same feel as other jocks.  Just keep in mind that the straps of a jock offer a different feel from that of thong-type underwear, so it may take a little getting used to if you're not accustomed to wearing a jockstrap.  All in all, this jockstrap by Bike offers the most when it comes to support, look and feel."
50,"I currently own a black leather backpack handbag, but I wanted one for summer use.  For some reason the beautiful light brown reminds me of leather sandals and breezy dresses.  It is a bit smaller than my current purse, but in summer I carry less, just my wallet, cellphone, small address book, pen and a small paperback book.  The leather smells so good.  The strap is ample and the handle is convenient for carrying the backpack.  I wish the zippered compartment's lining was a light color, but at least it opens up to give you exposure to locate items that sometimes fall to the bottom of the purse. The hidden compartment mentioned in the description is very small and doesn't have much room for a lot of items.  The quality of the item is very good and worth the price, although the $18.40 for shipping was a bit more than I wanted to pay.  All in all a good deal"
51,"I bought these for warmth. While they feel good, my feet are still a little cool when it gets below 30 degrees.  Also, after first gentle hand wash, they got a little ""nappy"""
52,"I got about 6 pairs of Gold Toe socks.  They're the most comfortable socks I've worn in a long time.  You don't even feel like you have socks on.  They fit well and are made well.  If your hesitating, no need.  I'm not sorry I bought them"
53,The Porthole Brief is a desk away from the office.  It has space for everything needed and is beautifully crafted
54,"The collar stays are great!  They came in a convenient little container, and now I'm not searching all over the laundry room floor for the collar stays that fell out of my husband's dress shirts.  The different lengths were helpful because he has different style shirts, and the collar stays came very quickly"
55,"I love these! So comfortable, price great, looks good, very happy!  If you are looking for a great walking shoe this is it.  Will buy again in the future & would highly recommend."
56,"I bought two in different colors and love them. They are soft but sturdy and practical. They are easy to wash, with plenty of fabric to cozy up around your legs and a slit side to make movement easy. The vee neck is flattering. You can't go wrong with the excellent price, either"
58,"This bra is very comfortable for both day or night.  Many wrap bras bind when you push the fabric down or to the side, but this bra has enough stretch to be comfortable.  This is probably a bra best for those with smaller chests"
59,"I thought that wearing a silk robe was more an affectation than anything else.  Happily, I was wrong.  This robe is well-made, comfortable, and it really looks nice."
60,This tie comes from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban the movie and lets just that it looks really good on me! The stripes are Gold and Red. It feels soooo smooth!! I recommend this to any Potter Fan
61,"Shoes are cute. I expected a plusher velvet, but they are nice anyways."
62,"Great tote for the price.  Strong, attractive and exactly as described.  Thanks"
63,This item is beautiful.  The company is great.  I received many compliments on these shoes.
64,"Solid materials, and great quality. It's very hard to get winkles on these, and comes with folds like on slacks. If you're going for the slighty sharp preppy look, these are for you."
65,These are the best slippers he has ever owned.  They are well made and are a great deal.  The uppers are actually sewn onto the sole which means you will a get miles out of these slippers.
66,"Columbia sport sandals for kids are great! We've bought them three years in a row now for our kids.

They hold up well, are comfy, and the colors are great.  Easy for the little ones to get on and off make getting in and out a breeze.  

They're well constructed, but the dirt starts to show on the nylon parts after a while. They won't really wear out before your kids feet grow to the next size"
68,This is a wonderful bra. Yes it does run in a larger size but if you get your fit right its the best bra you could own. I have a very large chest and i have never found as good of support as this bra gives me. I would diffently buy this bra again and again and again
69,"Hey,

I decided to review some things I didn't buy off Amazon, but I have owned for sometime that are really great items: the kind I would buy again for sure if they were lost. I would say lost or broken, but Jansport has lifetime warranties! If anything happens to your backpack, all you have to do is mail it to Jansport with a note of the problem, they will fix it for FREE and send it back to you. They will even send you a card while they have it telling you it misses you and will be back soon. Overall, these are such great products, you just have to get a Jansport if you're thinking of a backpack.

Also, I am in a review writing competition with a friend of mine and if this review is helpful, which I hope it really is, I would love to have your yes vote!

With Care, 
Sa"
70,"Shoes are fairly expensive, but incredibly comfortable and durable. I bought 2 pair of these about 3 years ago and have been wearing each pair 2-3 days/wk since then and they still are very comfortable with minimal upper or treadwear.  The shoe sizes 1/2 size small - I normally wear a US 9 1/2 and got these in a size 9.  I definitely plan to get another pair or 2 when these finally wear out."
71,"A great piece for the costume.  I added some braids, beads, and dreadlocks to make more identical, but the base is good.  Scarf color is lighter and more shiny than in the pics, but was dulled easily with light spray and magic marker graphics.  I couldn't have been Capt. Jack without it"
72,My daughter absolutely loved the wallet. I personally did not realize it was a very popular item with the girls
73,"This item appears to be a short mini skirt in the picture, but it runs kinda long.  I wouldnt reccomend going down a size though, it runs small around the waist.  I do like the skirt though, its a really cute plaid and nicely styled"
74,"This is a very sexy outfit.  My one complaint is that the ""3 piece set"" is actually two pieces; the top being one while the skirt is attached to the g-string.  This doesn't take too much away from the outfit, but it would have been nice to have been given a more accurate description of the product before buying it"
75,I buy these tights for both of my daughters and have found them to be very durable
76,"Excellent quality briefs and my husband really liked them.  They are a simple style, but look very classy as far as briefs go.  I would highly recommend these"
78,Product ordered came in on time and in very good condition. They fit fine
79,"I bought these boots just in time before the crazy weather started.  Let me tell you,these boots are great!!!!!!  I read all the reviews and bought them a half size bigger and now they're a little big, regardless, I love them and another thing, they keep my feet very warm and cozy"
80,Good quality lining in the front.  I wish there is lining in the back too.  Delivery is fast
81,"My husband bought me a pair of these Minnetonka Pile Lined Indoor/Outdoor Slippers so that I would stop stealing his ""outdoor slippers"" everytime I needed to take the dogs out (smile) - and these slippers are AMAZING!!!  The insides are so soft that it's like being in ""foot Heaven"", and they are extremely well made!  Plus, although it says that these are ""Men's slippers"", the style is such that it could easily be worn by both men & women alike.

Overall, I would highly recommend these slippers to anyone who is looking for a slipper that it's both well-made & super comfortable.  You really can't go wrong with these Minnetonka's!"
82,"This is a pretty bra, very sleek.  It looks great under sweaters and tees.  I like that the straps stay in place and there is no show through"
83,"I purchased the Black Wallabee Boots for my son for Christmas.  He had a pair of the tan ones, but they don't sell them anywhere close to my home.  He's in college in another town.  I found them on Amazon, less expensive than what he paid for them in the store.  The black ones are sharp!  He loves them, and said they are very comfortable.  I will keep my eye on any Wallabee Boot sales . . when he likes a shoe, it's a big deal.
Thank you.
Sand"
84,"I ordered these a few days ago and I must say that I love these. I wanted the teal color but they were not available in my size-7 1/2 med. Although the heels are about 4 inches high, they are comfy. You can't expect to walk miles in these shoes but if you take regular breaks, then, yes. It will add pizzazz to any dress and will make your legs look longer. I looked so much taller than my 5.4"" that I love to look at myself. I received many complments too.

The only thing I didn't like is that Amazon displays some shoes that are not in stock at all. Why not wait for the stock and then display??? Atleast we get to know that they are available !!!!!"
87,"This is a great nursing bra! I have no trouble opening and closing the bra with one hand and it is very comfortable. It is very soft, but still provides good support. The washing instructions say to hand wash in cold, but I have washed it on the delicate cycle about 6 times and it looks great. I am so happy with my purchase, I am buying another one right now"
88,The moment I tryed it on the fit was great I've never come a cross a cami that fits so well and comfortable
90,"I am a larger guy and needed a light windbreaker-type jacket with a hood that would also keep the rain off my head (that's Seattle for ya).  Since none of the local stores had these in stock I searched Amazon and found this one.  The jacket is of excellent quality and is better than I expected it to be.  It breaks the wind extremely well, and if you really need to bundle up there are velcro strips on the sleeve openings, draw strings around the waist and snaps that go over the zipper.  All in all this is an excellent wind breaker jacket.  It won't keep you warm in very cold weather, but it is one of the best light jackets I've ever owned.  

When I placed my order on November 16, 2006 I chose 'standard shipping' and was promised a shipping date of Nov. 20 to Nov. 27.  I received the item on Nov. 27.  I can't say for sure whether I would have received it sooner had Thanksgiving day not fallen within that week, so I won't really complain about the receiving date.  

My COMPLAINT with the order, however, is this:  From the time I placed my order to the time I received the jacket, the advertised sale price DROPPED by 25 percent, $10.00.  I ordered the jacket and paid $39.95 but by the time I got it, the price was $29.99.  This didn't seem right to me.  I've written to Turfer for a resolution but have not yet received one.  If this is resolved favorably, I'll edit this review.  

Except for the price dispute, I highly recommend this jacket if you need a light windbreaker type jacket.  It will serve you very well.  Just make sure that you get the right price!! 

EDIT:  Still no response from Turfer on the price change, but Amazon's stated policy is that prices and availability may change without notice, so I guess it's buyer beware.  I notice that as of today the price on this item is still $29.99.  I've been using it for 2 months now and I must say it's a fantastic lightweight jacket.  I want to buy another one but I'm afraid the second I order it the price will drop to $19.99!!!"
91,"I have worn this particular style of Birks for over fifteen years now, and except for an occasional dress-up occasion, they are all I wear if the weather is warm. They mold to your feet, wear like iron, and your local shoe repair shop can give you a new set of soles for around $30.  This is the lowest price I have found except for a German site on ebay. Love 'em"
92,"I haven't had a chance to wear yet, but this is a great wedge for women who cant wear super high heels.  Great support and your feet look super sexy"
93,"I thought this was just going to be another wallet, and it is, but it's not. Once I received it I took off the tags and put it to use. Now I am in the military and stationed in Italy so in my wallet I have Dollars and Euro. Normal American dollars fit just fine into my new wallet however the Euro sticks out just a bit but not enough to be a problem. Also I have uniform standards that I must adhere to so I like not having a wallet bulging out in my back pocket and it does not leave a wallet mark on my uniforms. So I must say that all in all I was very happy with my purchase and have no plans to go back to a normal ""back pocket"" wallet or any other brand any times soon"
94,"these socks are packaged nicely, great for babies 0-9 months. colors available are good for any type of outfits"
95,Very cute!  Excellent price.  Comparible shipping prices and fast delivery!  Would buy from them again!
96,I bought this for my Granddaughter that we are expecting in March.  I couldn't believe the great quality it is for the price.  Can't wait to see her in it.
97,after all these years buying this wrangler product this by far has been the cheaper price that i've ran across. i love it.
98,"I have a black one. Besides looking cool and the nice belt buckle design, this key chain is made with good materials. The Italian leather smells great, the snaplink is really strong, yet easy to open when necessary. It cut down in the number of times I went searching for my keys. The belt buckle is actually functioning and it locks 2 key rings. This means that you can fairly quickly remove (or add) key rings. That is low tech at its best!

I would recommend it as a gift for men"
99,"This is a sharp pair of demi-boots. The wedge heel is just the right height to wear all day. I think they run a half size large, so the size 7 ( my regular size) slipped a bit at the heel. Wearing a heavy pair of socks with them helped immensely. I really like this pair and will wear them often"
100,"It's not just the brand and certainly not just the name. Under Armour just uses better material, designed and sewn better than their competition. I've tried shirts of similiar material from dozens of manufacturers. Some I still own, others are long since thrown away. None are as comfortable or fit as well as this one. Simply better than the rest. 5 Stars"
101,"You can kind of see through them, kind of not. The skirt is like a nifty mini, the G-string is not uncomfortable. This outfit looks good on my girlfriends, looks good on me and it'll look good on you too"
102,"I ordered this purse to go with a brown and gold outfit for a wedding.  I received at least a half-dozen compliments on the bag, since it was such an unusual color for an evening bag.  People were amazed at the quality for the price.  I look forward to further shopping with this seller.  You won't be disappointed!  M. Lovejo"
103,"The cotton fabric of these bodysuits is really soft and cool, and didn't shrink when washed. The only thing I would comment on is the sizing; the 0-3 months and 3-6 months bodysuits we ordered were almost exactly identical sizes and it would be hard to tell the two sizes apart without actually checking the label. 

-reviewed by the wif"
104,I was very pleased with this product.  It was nicer then I thought it would be and it came packaged very nicely
105,"They are sturdy, fashionable, and run true-to-size.  The price was very reasonable, and I'm very pleased with my purchas"
106,"I bought Silver & Black to wear at weddings. These wraps are great and very elegant. They're light and soft, just as described. They also make great scarves"
107,I just got mine. I am very happy with it. I ordered another one right now too!I cannot believe the price.I am very happy with my purchase
108,This backpack/daypack is a great value.  Super efficient pocket layout.  Beware that the straps are a little stiff when brand new and will take a few hikes to soften up.  I plan to by a few more for wife and kids
109,"I saw these shoes at Macy's yesterday for $36. They only had the red. IMO, the red is a bright, clown red. It's not a bad red, it's just a true red with no subtlety. I almost considered getting them, but I reminded myself that I was on the hunt for a black patent, pointy toe skimmer. I am *so* glad Macy's did not have the black because I got them thru Amazon for $22.

I believe the shoe fits true to size. I am a 7.5M, period. In pointy shoes, I sometimes go for an 8 or avoid pointys altogether. I was going to listen to the reviews here and order an 8, but I tried on the 8 at Macy's and it was too big. I think it was a bit stretched it given that it was the floor model, but I figured even a brand new size 8 would be too big. 

I ordered & recvd a 7.5M. When I recvd the shoes today and put them on they were snug. Not snug in a tight or uncomfortable way. They just fit exactly to my foot. This is a leather upper and not man made. So the patent looks black and shiny! It's not cheap looking at all. The point comes to a nice triangle and isn't exagerrated. Given that they are leather, I expect them to stretch a little to my feet. 

The shoes measures 10.5"" from the point to the middle of the heel. The point to the top of the shoe is 3"" and there is 1"" between my big toe and the point. There is comfortable room to move the toes and because the shoe is leather, it will form a bit to the feet as you wear them. I have experienced that already just walking around the house. The shoe looks low cut on the sides, but my foot stays completely in the shoe when I am walking. I'll be watching to see if I end up with a line/bend across the front of the shoe. By the time that happens -- if it ever does -- I will certainly have gotten my $22 out of them. 

And finally, I am 5'2"" and I tend to avoid pointy toe shoes because it sometimes looks like I am wearing skis. These shoes are great because they elongate my leg and don't create a costume-y look. They look great peeking out of the jeans I have on and I expect them to look good w/the new capri leggings I got the other day. 

Highly recommended!"
110,I had many problems with the Nike shoe- this product saved my feet! I can use my old running shoes and the pouch keeps the sensor safe and secure. I have had no problems with it.
111,Very happy with the purchase. The pant is exactly what I was looking for! Remarkable comfort
112,"nice boots... looks great... i love them... the only problem is that the sole wears too fast... and they are not too much confortable.
this boots aren't made for walking as the nancy sinatras' ones...
but as i told you, they have a nice look and you just need to put some inner soles to make them a little softer.."
113,"I love this bag! I purchased the pink/chocolate color and I get alot of compliments on how cute it is. I am in my early 20's and I have a 2 and half year old and this bag can hold what I need for him as well as my things and still not look bulky or overstuffed and at the same time, is very stylish. I really like those trendy baby bags for those young moms, but they are very expensive. This is lightweight, made of cotton, so very easy to clean. I chose standard shipping and it came so quickly. I am very satisfied with my purchase"
114,"I love the look and they are very comfortable on my feet. I got the black and white, and I love them with a pair of capris or long shorts"
116,"Once while traveling, I had a big blister on my heel and needed something that wouldn't rub my heel. I happened to get a pair of Crocs since the strap can be moved forward to look like trim over the front. I was pleasantly surprised by the Crocs - very cushiony soft, like walking on air. Also the material is insulating enough to keep your feet warm yet the air holes ventilate enough that your feet don't get sweaty either. 

I originally got the Crocs for temporary use but now I look forward to slipping into them everyday when I get home. It's wonderful to feel such cushioning on my feet with every step. They've replaced my slippers, mocassins, surf shoes and sandals."
117,"Better than I expected and shipped very quickly, S&K has great service"
118,"My husband was so pleased with this shoe...the fit, the look and the color was as described.  He could not believe I ordered it on the internet"
119,"Great item, soft and comfortable, but lose support around legs. Stretches out, not a major concern but could be improved"
120,I love these boots! I got one size smaller than my street shoe and they were snug enough to fit perfect. I can fit pants in them or over them and I have not had a problem yet
121,This bag is much larger than expected.  It is very spacious with two interior zip pockets (one on each side). The bag smells of fabulous genuine leather every time you unzip it.  The handbag came with an authentication card and a dust bag for storage.
122,"I bought these slides for house slippers based on the other reviews I read.  I will give one caution, you may not like them in the first few weeks.  The first few times I wore them, my feet were really sore after about an hour or two.  I recommend wearing them with socks for a week or so until all the nobbies soften and become more flexible.  After this break-period, you'll be able to wear them any way you like and you'll love how they feel after a long day of wearing shoes"
123,The gazebo is very sturdy and works great in the sun and rain.  Adding the team cover is a great way to show your team pride during tailgate parties!  It takes a bit of practice to set up the unit but I believe that all gazebos have the same problem.
124,Just what I needed to get me through the very cold spell we had in February.  My dog even (accidentally) chewed on them and there was no damage. ;-) Great product!
125,I had been searching everywhere for the perfect pair of flip flops and I finally found them! I recieved them in record time and they are awesome! I would absolutely shop with them again. Thank you guys
126,"This is an excellent little case -- it won't save your Zen if you drop it down the stairs or from a height, but it will cushion and protect it through normal use, especially the screen.  The built in stand is clever, if a little flimsy.  The armband...well, it's functional, but I wouldn't suggest using it for running a marathon; I'd recommend buying a smaller, cheaper MP3 player for running, anyway.
All in all, this case is an excellent buy!  I'd recommend it to everyone who buys a Zen -- it's the case Creative should have included"
127,"These are among the most comfortable thongs that I own.  My previous favorite was ""old navy's"" cotton thongs, but these now take first place!"
128,Nice shirt that arrived quickly and I would not hesitate to do business with this company again
129,"It's a little on the thin side for snowy or freezing weather, but great in keeping the chill off when you're out and about, or at the game. The blue is actually more of a royal blue than navy blue, but the lettering is well stitched and is the same quality used on MLB baseball caps (also has the MLB logo on back). It folds up easily and can be tucked into a jacket pocket with room to spare. The price is great and makes a great gift"
132,"If you have the body to show for it, by all means wear it alone"
133,"I purchased these shoes for my son who is somewhat hard to please at times but he likes these quite well. The look and feel of them is great in his opinion, he thinks they are stylish and very comfortable. He slips them on everyday after work"
134,"I wanted an inexpensive bike short with expensive styling and that is exactly what I got.  Not too tight in the legs, as many cycling shorts can be and I like that.  Perfect for indoor cycling classes, which is what I ordered them for.  Comfortable and affordable, perfect"
135,"it's a comfortable formfitting t-shirt dress.  whenever i wear it, i get compliments"
136,nice shirt.  very hard to find in stores so it's worth the wait and the cash
137,"I don't quite understand why backseam pantyhose and nylon stockings are not more popular with females. Backseam pantyhose are not especially easy to find, but the allure of a backseam in pantyhose or nylon stockings is very sexy. 

   I enjoy wearing this Hue Black Sheer Backseam pantyhose, as it is comfortable, sensual and sexy. Keep in mind though this pantyhose has a control top that is not sheer. Therefore it would be best not to wear this pantyhose with quite short minidresses and mini-skirts. 

   I would like to see more backseam pantyhose offered, especially in beige."
139,"I got these for a friend who has a 55 ford and goes to car meets wearing 50's outfits.  She says they fit great and are SO comfortable to wear.  They came on time, exactly as ordered.  I couldn't be more pleased"
140,My wife has been looking for a pair of seamed pantyhose and didn't think such a thing existed. Last week she wore this pair to a re-enactment and received many favorable comments. Highly recommende
141,"I really love these training pants.  the best ones I have gotten so far.  My 22 month old is pretty much potty trained with an occasional accident.  These training pants are a little thicker then regular underwear, helps to keep the occasional accident contained.  Very soft and fit nicely"
142,"This was a terrific set - especially for the Lowest Price we could find online!

There are 2 mftrs who make this (we bought both!), and this one is the best!

No, it's not HIGH Quality Scarf Set, but it's the NOVELTY of the Harry Potter Licensing and unless you're looking for an expensive scarf set, it's perfect.

Would also recommend this merchant as they offer the Best Price, Quick Delivery and courteous communications"
144,"This case is great for anyone who wants an unobtrusive sturdy, and attractive case for their mp3 player. it holds up well and it even makes the buttons easier to push. thank"
145,"These pumps are very cute, but don't plan to wear them more than 3 hours. After 3 hours I almost couldn't walk. They a little bit to high and to narrow....But way to cute...they perfect for a dinner date, but not for a dancing date.:"
146,"Picture does not make justice for this Jeans. I am a size 26 but i got this Jeans in a size 25 and they fit perfect. Jeans snuggle the 1rst time you wear them, but they ""lose"" softly while you are wearing them, giving you a look of a sexy relaxed Jeans that sits on the hips and very flattering on your ""back view"", without being snuggle, They are FLARED not bootcut, VERY long inseam but that makes the Jeans absolutely HIP, but very classy, Gorgeous for long legs, skinny look. Love It !!!"
147,"These were purchased for a wedding.  The quality is very good.  We would like to see solid black offered and argyle in black,pink, grey, and white.

Thank you,

Joy Ree"
150,"Ordering online and not being able to try on clothing can be risky but it paid off with this purchase. I just wish it wasn't ""hand wash only""."
152,My husband thought these were great.  And we both like the stripes
153,"I purchased the scarlett version of this bag more than two years ago, and it's still in perfect condition!  The color doesn't fade when you wash it, and it's the most durable bag I've ever owned.  I will not, refuse to, absolutely cannot make me carry a purse, but I carry this bag everyday.  The very front zipper pocket is great for change, the small zipper holds my keys and cell and a host of other small items I always seemed to be losing before, and the large pocket is big enough to fit several medium sized paperbacks in.  It's perfect for everyday use, and will last forever. The ""backpack straps"" are comfortable and have never broken.  I was so excited when I found this on Amazon, and IN EVERY COLOR!  Before, the selection was red and black only, so this is fabulous!  Buy this bag, you will love it"
154,Thisis a great jacket. It will be put to good use.  Thanks for the super service
155,"These boots are very cute and seem to be holding up well through gentle use.  My son has worn them about 4 times, just for puddle jumping and playing in the mud.  They are nicely and deeply treaded on the bottom.  Since we use them only infrequently, I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars since I can't comment much as to their ruggedness"
156,The pollie open-toe shoe is a very stylish shoe that looks really good on
158,"I love these sweats.  The only drawback I find is that they do not have pockets.  However, most sweat pants don't have pockets, so I am used to that.  They fit great - but then again, I ordered the correct size and did not count on my washing machine to 'turn them into the (right) size."
160,The leather was good quality.  The wallet was well constructed.  I gave it as a gift and it turned out better than I it looked on the internet.  Grade A product
161,"This is a good, functional scarf.  The material is typical polar fleece.  It's soft, but not exceptionally so.  It's very warm, but you can breathe through it if you use it to cover your face.  It's made from acrylic and polyester, and it is machine washable.

One complaint I might have is that the edges are finished with stitching that feels rough to the touch.  Also, I would have liked to have seen a few more inches of length.  But it's certainly long enough to use.

Overall, this scarf is nothing to get excited about, and the full retail price seems a bit high, but if you get it on sale, you won't regret it.  It does what you need a scarf to do"
162,"definitely like this boot. it does run small around the calf. i have small calf and it fits like a glove. Really nice and sexy to be worn with skirt. Good quality and pretty boot, definitely worth to buy"
163,After my first purchase of these jeans I had to order another 2 pair because they are the only pants I will ware now. These jeans are extremely confortable in every way and the do not get cought under a boot heel like most other pants. I HIGHLY recommend these jeans to anyone!!!!
164,"I was looking forever for a bag that was cute enough and small enough for a baby laundry bag.  Finally I came across this, and I am so happy we have it.  It is totally cute hanging in by new baby girls room... and it's not so big that her little clothes get lost in it.  Also real easy to wash.  I just stuck it in with the baby clothes the last time I did a wash, and dried it on the highest setting.  Came out great.  ;)  Perfect for a baby room when you are looking for a laundry bag solution in a small space.  :)

I want one for myself now!  :"
165,"These shoes are adorable and perfect for summer!! I love mine!!

The only negative thing is that they are wide. I have normal size feet and ordered my regular shoe size. They fit length wise but are very spacey width wise"
166,"I have tried MANY nursing bras.  This one is the ONLY ONE for me.  I am a size 36C, and it gives great support.  It gives plenty of room for when your bbs are at their fullest.  Prone to clogged milk ducts, and having had no luck with other bras, I was hesitant to waste my money again.  This bra has given me no problems whatsoever.  It's like the miracle helper that no one tells you about.  Don't wait, GET IT!!"
167,"This versatile boot(s) works for the casual office and best on the weekends. Great deal (price wise: $29.79) too! 

There is a smooth, leather upper that stays put with a stretch zipper (fabric around the zipper, but the rest is smooth, soft leather). 

Although fits true to the size and it reads ""8 ½ M,"" at first it felt a bit narrow (especially around the ankle) but it became loose after I wear it.  Advanced cushioning, padded insole for comfort and flexible sole.

Over all, very comfortable and classy!"
169,"I ordered this dress by the sizing listed.  It arrived quickly, but was much larger than anticipated. The exchange was extremly easy and we are very satisfied with the product and the excellent servic"
170,I bought these for my boyfriend for christmas. As a mechanic pockets and style are essential. He has a drawer full of the cell phone double knee dickies but when he receieved the CARGO dickies he makes me wash the 2 pair in between wears so he can continue to wear them.  The Right Cargo Pocket has an internal smaller sectioned off pocket where your cell phone fits nicely. (at least ours it does we have a tmobile slider T809)
171,"I was born and raised in a tropical climate, so when it gets cold up here in the northeast I really feel it.  These ear muffs have surpassed my expectations in terms of warmth. I'll never have to experience frozen ears again!  They look quite stylish as well.  The texture of the sheepskin appears to be much more even than what is shown in the picture.  My only gripe is that the band is not covered with material, as depicted here.  If you don't mind that, I highly recommend this item"
172,"This is the best nursing bra that I purchased.  It took me a few tries to get it right, but when I finally found this one I purchased a few.  The style and fabric is very supportative and I love the fact that it is not an underwire.  My only negative comment is that it is not available in a nude or bone color.  Every nursing mom should own this bra.  It is well worth the price. One last suggestion...get properly fitted by a professional."
173,These trunks offer the support of a brief and the comfort of a boxer-brief with minimal coverage - Great undertwear
174,Product arrived in a very timely matter and the item works great
175,"The warmest, most  lasting, and  most  comfortable men's sock  on  the  market!  Excellant  Price $$"
176,"These are very cute and comfortable shoes, and look great with jeans or dressed up.  I have wide feet and they were very accommodating- I wouldn't recommend them for narrow feet though."
177,"This was my first time ordering something like this... and I was concerned that I would get the wrong size, since I am also a medium, but everything fits perfect for me. Contrary to the review below me, I personally like the material, I find it quite comfortable. It's lacy-like and frilly and not only looks sexy, but makes you feel sexy. The shipping was lighting fast as well. I will definately order from this company again. ="
178,"I love these sneakers, I wear them all the time.  I now have them in two colors.  I bought them for $40 in a boutique in Venice CA for $40 and found them on Amazon for HALF!  Amazing.  SHOP AMAZO"
179,Not best for running but look very cool.  comfortable enough to wear for styl
180,"I was a little concerned with the product ordered until my friend opened the package. She loved it, thought it felt great when put on. If she is happy, I am happy."
181,"They are soft, made of quality fabric, snug, but not too snug"
182,"Yeh, these are really great socks... but what's up with James? If new socks changed my life, hey I need to get a little something goin' on. Back to the socks...my favorite, in black, low cut, workin' out or hangin' out"
183,"I gave these boots to my daughter for Christmas.  She loved them and they fit really well.  They run larger for their size, which is good, because my daughter is a size 11.  They do run big, but fit her great.  They also are a great quality.  And they are very much in fashion.  Great choice!"
184,"I bought this rather skeptically online, but turned out that these mittens (and other products from this company) are extremely soft and don't fade or shrink after washes. I'd highly recommend these for your baby's tender hands"
185,"This is the best fitting and most comfortable bra I have ever owned.  It gives a lovely shape.  The only problem is the fabric used to make it.  As another person has said, every one of these bras that I've bought has split.  The floral outer fabric is so fragile, I've even put my finger through a nearly new one!  Very disappointing.  I wish they would make this same bra out of some sturdier fabric.  Then it would be the perfect bra"
186,"I bought these jeans for my husband and he loves them and so do I.  They look great, and still look fresh after many months of washing.  Would buy again"
187,"I brought a couple pair of these to our little lingerie party, because I knew the girls would like them. I've been wearing them for over a year and I like them a lot. My husband does too. They look good, turn him on, turn me on too. You can't ask for more than that in a panty, now can you"
188,"The shoes are lovely and pretty sexy.
They are actually nicer than how the appear on internet (not to say the internet presentation is not also sharp and representative of the product).

I love high heel shoes. I have a collection of them. My husband, through surfing the internet for Valentine's Day found the site. 

What is exciting about the whole thing is I am pretty sure no one will have the same shoes in Ottawa!!!

Not having half sizes, we ordered size 7. They were too small so we reordered size 8. We will know for next time.

Spike Angel company is very professional and easy to deal with. They exchanged the shoes for the right size in no time"
189,This has been a great  shirt.  The color has stayed and is easy to wash and wear
191,"This product is a great alternative to the $30 cases I've seen. It has a belt clip that doesn't pop off. It's soft, and the cover flips over to make a little kickstand that holds the player up. I highly recommend it"
194,"I love this camisole. Very smooth, comfortable and definitely conceals the areas you wish. I do not wear a bar with this item and feel comfortable with the support I receive. Highly recommend."
195,"Backpack is light when empty, yet strong to curry the load of books to school. Side pocket for bottle very handy. Top pocket for CD player or small easy to reach items such as keys, very helpful and practical. I like the base of the backpack being dark color so  it doesn't look dirty from use"
196,"these work great, stay behind the scenes and last longer than expected. not a big fan on metal tie clips/tacks/bars or don't want to pay for one then these are perfec"
197,I ordered this shirt in a large for my husband & he is not a hard to fit large.  This large is a bit short.  The seller did ship fast though
198,Great product. The only reason for only 4 stars is the shipping was way overpriced
201,These shoes are fantastic! Not only are they super cute but they stay nice and clean. My son wears them ALL the time and dirt just doesn't stick so they always look very nice. The velcro shield on the front makes it easy for my toddler to take off and put on his own shoes
202,"I HAVE NEVER BEEN INTO FULL RIM HATS. I NEEDED ONE FOR THE WORK AND REST I DO SO I GAMBLED ON THIS. I AM VERY HAPPY THAT I DID. IT FITS PERFECTLY, AND ALREADY I HAVE BEEN THROUGH A TWENTY DEGREE DIFFERENCE WITH RAIN, AND BEING A GLASSES WEARER, I CAN SAY I AM DEFINITELY PLEASED. I RECOMMEND THIS HAT FOR ANYONE LOOKING FOR THIS TYPE OF PRODUCT FOR ANY REASON"
203,"It is comfortable, great for outdoor. But it is a little biger than its size. And overall the shoe is quite heavy"
204,I gave this as a gift to a friend and she said she LOVED it
205,"I ordered this black XL for a bridesmaid dress as well. At first I was concerned it may be too casual, but out of the package it looks quite elegant. The material feels like a good quality, not thin and cheap, and the broach doesn't look like a kiddy toy. I also had to double check measurements with the sizes because it didn't quite match up with my normal size. It definitely wears well without being clingy or riding up. Definitely pleased with the price for what I got"
206,This sandal is quite comfortable and pretty cute.  I would recommend it
207,"I found this bra in white at ROSS about 6 months ago for $4.99 and have been wearing it almost daily because it looks and feels so good with everything (tanks, tees, sweaters, etc.) while adding a little oomph. 
When I needed to buy a black bra, I looked up the info from the rapidly fading tag and couldn't resist getting one in every available color.
I cannot stand the look of bumpy padding, weird seams and unnatural silhouettes that I usually find with bras, so it was totally worth the splurge once I found a style that worked so well."
209,"We got these glasses for our two month old and they are certainly cool looking on our little cutie.  They are a little large for her, but still fit with the velcro on the adjustable band just barely connecting on her little head.  100% UV protection por los ojos es muy bueno"
210,"This is the second pair of these pants that I've bought and I now have them in black and olive green. My favorite thing about them is the way they slim my hips. I wear a size 12 (sometimes a 14) and ordered a Large the first time. They fit perfectly, though I had to pin the part around the ankle to keep it from being so blousy. I noticed that complaint on other reviews, but it's easy to pin it from the inside and remove some of the fullness. The slimness in the hips and the comfortable fabric completely make up for the ultra-fullness at the ankle. I get compliments on them everywhere I wear them and I can dress them up or down, with flats or heels, with no problem. I did make a mistake when I ordered the second pair and got an XL. I washed them on hot and dried them very hot, as well. They actually fit fine and are really comfortable--but I'll order the Large again next time, for sure. I'm going to order all the other colors available, and maybe even a second pair in the olive green since I wear them so much. They'll never go out of style. They're perfect for airline travel because you can put your boarding pass and I.D. in the pockets, while sending your carry-on or purse through the conveyor-belt security. I love these pants!"
212,"They were a nice quality, nicely priced, and were shipped promptly.  I would buy this brand again"
213,I bought these shoes for myself after trying them on locally due to the low price on amazon.  I have problems with most shoes due to their low profile and having a thick foot.  Additionally I like to wear arch support inserts due to my feet overpronating.  I found that these shoes would allow me to have my inserts in comfortably.  I would recommend these shoes to anyone with thicker feet
214,"These glasses are both attractive and effective. Well worth the money. At the price, you can afford to sit on them and so forth, which invariably happens anyway. They're also quite practical and very dark, which I didn't expect from such an inexpensive item.

I'll definitly buy these again the next time I need to recreate some Sisters of Mercy music videos"
216,"Well, I cannot speak for the previous commentor, but I have worn these for about 5-8 years. Yes, I have kept a pair that long! They haven't worn out at all. Of course, my underwear are much older, so the tag is in the back and says ""Life"". Life is by Jockey, but now that brand is exclusive to men's underwear. I plan on looking for these again at a store and trying them again. Well, so now I don't know how valid my review is because it's been so long, but the ones I do have are amazingly comfortable and I hope these live up to that"
217,"I have a hard time geting shoes that are wide enough, sometimes even if they say ""W"". But, I could not have asked for a better fit! These are very comfortable and they look great too"
219,"I've been looking for this specific color and style and went to every athletic shoe store in Phoenix and Las Vegas but could not find it until i happened to look on Amazon.  They, of course, had it and i ordered it immediately.  It took a little longer than expected to get the shoes but once they were here i slipped them on and they fit like a glove."
220,"I wrote a rave review of these the day I got them.  They were absolutely terrific and gave me purchase doing yoga on a slippery rug.  However, the next time I wore them for a longer session, they got stretched out. My toes kept falling out of them and they became twisted around my feet and just generally got in the way. 

I put on a new pair for another session and when doing any lunges or poses with my legs in a wide stance, they were very uncomfortable. 

Oh well.  The ""concept"" is great, but they don't really work unless you're doing very little movement.  I wish someone would come up with something like this that does the job"
222,I love how thin this product is. It fits the iPod nice and tight and keeps one of the nano's best features - its small size. I also learned to appreciate the screen protector while on vacation in Florida on the beach. The sand could have done a number on the nano's screen. I use the armband while exercising and it works well. Good product
223,"Cute little accessory for the price.  My slave boys have purchased Me one in every color.  Comfortable, too- no headaches"
225,"I have been on a relentless search for a product like this.  Other shapewear that i have tried is either very uncomfortable or has no control.  Finally, I have found a product that is both very comfortable and very supportive.  I truly look ten pounds lighter when I wear this.  You will get your money's worth with this product.  I have gotten the hight waist brief, the full control body suit and the camisoles.  They all work like magic."
226,"Once you wear a pair of the Hanky Panky panties, you will never want to wear another brand ever again! I was skeptical at first because they are one size fits all, but they really are so comfortable...I can't even tell I am wearing them! They are VERY sexy, which comfort and sexy usually don't belong in the same sentence when it comes to underwear!!! You will not be disappointed! I wear a lot of low rise jeans and they are well hidden underneath! They come in so many beautiful colors and cuts if you don't want the low rise fit"
227,"My daughter says: ""They are fun to wear. They make a clomp clomp noise. They are very wonderful to look at.""
I say: ""They are very cute. My daughter enjoys the heel."
228,"even the grease stains I get come off with minor effort. The pants always look great, right out of the dryer"
229,"I carry it everywhere I go -- it has enough capacity to contain pretty much everything I need -- faceplate to my car stereo, my camera, personal grooming supplies, even some clothes. Just throw it all in there and you're ready to spend a night at a friend's house.

Having two compartments really helps keeping things organized.

The back of the bag is well padded, and the bag is comfortable to carry for long periods of time"
230,"This shoe is elegant, it's comfortable, the stacked heel is just right, the height is perfect and over all is a beautiful pair of shoe.  I bought both colors that were available. 

Thank you."
231,With tougher airline baggage scrutiny overweight luggage can cost you a bundle. This little gadget paid for itself on our first trip. Much easier to use than the old bathroom scale we found this to be quite accurate and close to the scales at the check in counter. Now our neighbors all want to borrow it
232,They are sexy an I love I can have different colors for different days
233,"I bought these gloves for my kids' Hallowe'en costumes (they both wanted to be terrorists). The older one now uses them to protect his hands while doing weight training at the YMCA. They are great as part of a costume. As he's only used them a few times for weight training, I'm not entirely sure how they'll hold up under the long haul in that capacity.."
234,"As a matter of fact, I have them on right now!  Comfortable is the word.  Stylish, a great value for the buy."
235,"This is my first yoga mat and I am very happy with my purchase. It sorta smells when you first take it out of the package, but after a few uses it disappears. Plus, it is very pretty to look at. :"
236,"Best Wallet I've ever owned.  Keeps everything I need to carry organized.
I like the idea of front pocket wallets.   This one fits just right and is easy to get to when you need it."
237,I already knew it would be a pretty bad idea to buy a wig online but i didn't expect they would pack it up as badly as they did. It was totally mangled and mashed when I got it. They get four stars though because the wig itself is amazingly good once you restyle it yourself. Though I'm still having trouble with the spikes at the back of the hair
238,"I found the shoes to be pretty much what I'd hoped for, a pair for everyday use that had a certain style and comfortable feel.  The shoes have a scruffy look, which works for me. I like them"
239,"Great replica jersey, I expected it to be heavier, but actually like the fact that it was a bit of lightweight material. Some may or may not like that"
240,Got it for a friend for bird hunting and he totally loves it
243,Every morning my son would be so upset because he hated to put on his socks with seams in them.  Thank goodness we found TicTacToe Seamless socks.  They are excellent and morning is now a happy time
244,"I love wearing my Vote For Pedro tshirt to show how much I love the movie Napoleon Dynamite.

People who know Napoleon Dynamite will smile at me when I wear it.

Great shirt"
245,"I recently purchased these shoes for a night out on Valentine's Day with my boyfriend.  I had a great experience with this product and service.
The shoes themselves were completely wrapped up in their box.  Because of the delicate beading on the shoes, I was afraid that poor packaging may cause them to get damaged in shipment.Not so. Every part of the shoe was perfectly preserved and protected.

The beading has pink accents too.  I couldn't see the pink in the picture, but it's there.  These shoes are high, but comfortable. Definetly wear them about the house before taking them out. I'm thinking of getting them in Red too.

The seller itself, ShoeMall, sent me emails letting me know that my order was received, then another email letting me know that it was on it's way including the tracking number.
I highly recommend this shoe and seller based on my flawless purchasing experience"
246,"My boyfriend is a Big Lebowski fanatic, so his son and I bought this for him one Father's Day, and he loves it. The only issue I had with the shirt is that we got an extra-large size and it still fit a little tightly (he's not a huge man). I also think I remember noticing that the graphic was a little crooked, which was not very noticible unless you looked more closely. He still appreciated this gift, though"
247,"For the money, the package containing two docking/charger multipurpose cables, AC and car charger adapters, and the silicone skin case was a great deal!  Overall this was a great buy for me.  The only criticisms I can make are (1) the skin was a bit thicker than I had envisioned.  However, the slightly thicker form factor my Zen Vision M with the skin is balanced by the added drop protection.  And (2) the skin covers the lighted blue buttons giving the whole player a slightly less cool appearance.  Having said that, I'd gladly make this purchase again given the opportunity"
248,"Pros - These shoes are stylish and fit well
Cons - A little heav"
249,"I found this product to be of very high quality and the transaction of the product was great.
I recommend this for anyone looking for great bag, especially as a gift"
250,"I ordered this in aqua and was quite pleased -- the color and quality are great! If you think it may be too small, as one reviewer suggested, why not buy two? I love mine"
251,"this thong has the best feel ever in a thong. when I where it I feel as if I can do anything, and I feel very sexy in it"
252,I bought these for my dad for xmas... he loved them....they are so soft and very high quality
253,I had never bought shoes online before. I was having bad luck shopping in the stores in the malls and not being able to find my size in what I liked. So I decided to give online shoe shopping a try. The shoes arrived on time and they fit perfectly. I love them. They are very comfortable. I get lots of compliments on them. They worked perfectly for dressing up a casual outfit when I went cruising on the Mediterrean
254,"The material of the shirt is good, fits good except the fact that it is shorter than it looks on the pictur"
255,"This extremely comfortable, good-looking and effective minimizer has enabled me to wear one size smaller.  Also, the straps never slip off the shoulder.  I wish I had found this bra years ag"
256,"With a good selection of colors to go with the casual style, to say I love these shoes is an understatement. They are very comfortable, and have grown on me so much, they are about the only casual style shoes I have bought in the past few years"
257,"This hoodie paired with the matching pants is such a bargain!  Together, the whole outfit is $26!  Where else can you find such a buy?  This hoodie is very well made-just to be expected from Soffe.  Very comfortable!  But, you do need to know that the jacket is a short cropped length.  It does not meet at the waist of the pants.  Very cute and stylish"
258,Good shoes at the price.  Nice style and comfort
259,I bought a pair of Shakas for my husband (these shoes/sandles are not what he would have picked) and he is surprised how much he loves them. He is going to order another pair in a differnt color. I have a pair as well and love the comfort and support
260,Great cap.. quality is top notch.. Price is also great.
261,"I ordered this handbag for my 19-year-old niece as a birthday gift.  When she opened the package, she said ""VERY cool!"" with a huge smile!  We went over the details and agreed that the size is just large enough to hold the essentials (cell phone, keys, lipstick, compact, pen, credit card) and that the style is versatile, it goes with an elegant evening gown as well as with blue jeans.  Also, the silver tone is a great match for all her favorite colors:  Pinks purple, blues, black, white.
So she loves it, and I am happy"
262,Very comfortable shoe.  True to size.  Order was received very quickly and I was very satisfied.  Wish they would have had my size in black as well.
263,"Nice pair of slippers with great looks... I love the way they massage the feet when walking... if I had to choose one downfall, I would say they get dirty pretty quickly, and since the massaging spikes are hard to get into, it's harder to clean them... otherwise a decent pair of slippers... I'd definitely buy another pair in the futur"
264,These shoes were a terriffic deal at the sale price.  My son had a soccer tournament this weekend and did not even take them off in between games (5 hours).
265,"I had purchased another name brand and had trouble with my undershirts shrinking to the point that I couldn't even tuck them in.

I've had the Jockey brand for several months and shrinkage has been minimal. Good job"
266,"I bought this as a Christmas gift because it is shown and described as a briefcase; however, potential buyers should be aware that it is actually a case for a laptop computer. We were planning to buy a laptop anyway, so we kept the bag. As a laptop bag, it is high quality and plenty roomy."
267,this backpack is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cute i bought this to use for a diaper bag on the simple fact it nicer looking than the old diaper bag the hospital gave me and is of better qualit
268,"My husband really likes these swimming trunks, and you can't beat the price and free shipping"
269,held me top in place all night did not even know i was wearing it after a while
270,Excellent fit for us overly endowed folks.  Wanted another one so just went on line to Bali and they sent me to Biels in Florida.  On time delivery and product was as asked for
272,"This is an excellent shoe. It is true to fit and looks great. Note that it is also airport and nuclear plant safe for metal detectors. Very comfortable and fits to your foot shape within days, which is amazing compared to other shoes"
273,"I thought this product did exactly what I wanted it to. However, in order to get a loose rashguard fit (which is what most people want if you're using your rashguard as a cover up instead of its most often intended use) you will need to get at least two sizes larger"
274,"what a wonderful set of socks, the receiver of the gift was extremely happ"
275,"My mom makes me wear briefs, i dont mind them but i would rather wear something else because other kids give me a hard time about it most of the pantsing and wedgies in the locker room is in good fun but sometimes i get my head flushed in the toilet.  The briefs fit and feel great exept for when the waist band is up to my neck"
276,"This is not your typical lunch bag, for several reasons. This bag is very large and accomodating of all your needs, male or female. It is indeed very roomy and I would classify it as a daybag or travelbag because it isn't as limited as most ""lunchbags"", but still great for days at the office. For those of you that are troubled by coworkers ""borrowing"" your food and drinks from the company refrigerator, your troubles will be over with this bag. Tons of room to include cooling packs to keep at least a long day's worth of food and drinks chilly. The top of the bag has a seperate section that will hold all your other daily needs, whether it be reading material, including full size magazines you won't have to roll up or to fit in, medications, keys, cell phone, PDAs and what have you. The other compartments will accomodate you further. Conveniently, there are compartments where you can keep things hidden, so that personal items or valuables don't have to be displayed at any time, unless you choose to do so. This bag appears to be really well made, nothing cheap about it or ill planned. The zipper pulls alone tell the story, large, heavy and solid, accomodating for the smaller hand all the way up to very large men's hands. The stitching appears to be very well done and not prone to come apart easily. The dual handles at the top will allow for carrying with one hand, or clip on the adjustable strap for a more hands free tote. The thickness of the insulation is more than adequate, much thicker than most of the off the shelf type insualted bags, it is what you would expect in a premium bag. The fabric is quality denier that looks like it will be able to hold up to heavy use and easy to wipe clean, like most denier. I would not be surprised to see a flight crew carrying this insulated tote, as it has the style of simple elegance that you usually see with their carryons, suitable for even a daybag phobic male, but sleek enough for a woman to feel as though she hasn't just joined a brown bagger construction crew. This bag doesn't look out of place in the office or at a worksite, the beauty of classic neutral design for the causual person or professional. It has enough capacity to work for a picnic bag for several people. My mother was eyeing it for use to carry all her copious amounts of makeup on her trip to Vegas, with keeping all of it cool in mind. That plot didn't succeed, it has not yet seen Vegas, but nice try mom, lol. The sticker shock for this bag may seem high if you are used to throw away bags from mass retailers, but this is a worthwhile investment for those needing quality and more space. Overall value very high and more than worth the money. Hey, just what the coworkers swipe in a month's time might pay for the whole bag by itself."
277,This dress is high quality material and is very comfortable to wear.  The top part of the dress has to be altered but the waist fits fine.  I agree with another reviewer that this dress runs a little big.  It even came with optional straps and wrap.  Definatly a great bargain
278,"Description says to order 2 sizes smaller than street shoe. I normally wear a 6.5 and ordered a 4.5. They are just a little bit too small. I should have ordered 1.5 sizes smaller than street shoe. Other than that, no complaints! They are great shoes"
280,"I ordered this shirt hoping it matched 5 others I had bought at a store
for my wedding party. I called the company, they explained the shirt in detail. I ordered it and received it promptly, and it was a perfect match.
Thank Yo"
281,"Its very light, nice looks(blue in color) and spacious back pack... I use it for my office and also when ever I go for some outing.. It can hold all the essential things that I need.. I like this bag a lot.. very much recommended"
283,"Finally after going through many cases, this one is the only one I found that works for the thicker 60GB Zen.  Shame on Creative for their responses to me and their recommendations of so many cases that do not fit this player.  Huge Kudos to this company that have finally made my Xmas gift functional for hiking and jogging for me"
284,"My daughter got this set for Easter last year and just adores it, esp. the umbrella which she uses any possible time she can.  I wouldn't say it's cheaply made but it's just not as well made as the raincoat.  The little ""button"" on top to finish popped off within a month and can't really be glued back on.  It doesn't affect the umbrella's use but it's just one of those annoying things"
285,"It goes with almost everything, works with day and night wear, and is beautiful as well as sexy. And I'm usually PICKY PICKY, although obsessed with shoes.  Oh, and I'm French, so I should know... LO"
287,"Well I was meaning to write you guys about that I ask for 2X-large but you guy send me a LG/XL shirt I did not want to send it back, because i was looking for that kind of shrit for over two years. next just make sure that you send a right order that ask for it if don't have just say so."
291,These boots are so sexy and will make you so much taller when you're wearing them. I absolutely love my new boots and they look so good with a pair of jeans and comfortable enough to wear all day long. You'll love them as much as I do. The size fits a little on the big side so best thing would be to go to a Nine West store to try out the size before you purchase online but online prices are definately cheaper. What a deal!!
292,"I love these undershirts. They are better than onesies especially for newborns. Onesies slip over a baby's head whereas these shirts don't. Much easier to dress a newborn. I also liked the ""built-in"" mittens so baby can't accidentally scratch herself. I told my sister about these and she bought some for her newborn son. She loves these shirts, too. AND...you can't go wrong with white"
293,"Garment was of nice quality, shipped super fast! Will order more from webundies"
294,This is a nice case if you are looking for something compact.  I have a Kodak Easy Share digital camera and it fits perfect inside.  The case has a nice size front pouch and 2 side pouches for easy storage
295,"I love these boots. The leather is soft, they are very, very comfortable although it is a high heel, and they keep your legs warm (due to their 15 inch in length). These elegant boots are true to fit, classy, you and will get many compliments. They do have a gap at the top, but even with a mini skirt you look natural, so do not worry. I got them on sale from Amazon with free shipping, so that was a big plus for me. Way to go Amazon!"
296,"The garter fit great but i dont think barbie could fit in the panty. It said plus size but some how i dont think they realized what plus size is... for sure not a size 2. Loved the thought though that my client thought enough to buy this for me off my wish list here on amazon.
Huggs
Lizz"
297,There so warm and cozy for those long winter nights and they're good for mountian hikers. The keep your feet warm and dry
298,"Hello!!!  I ordered these jeans on sale at $19.99.  I really love these jeans!  They are a comfortable strech material.  They do seem to run a little big, though.  I am a size eleven, and I should have ordered a size nine.  Sence they were so comfy and nice, I went ahead and ordered a size nine also, and just kept a hold of the size eleven for my ""fat"" days.  (HA!)  I do recomend these jeans!!!  They are a great buy!!!  Especially at $19.99.  I sure hope this helps and that my review is as acurate as possible!  I am a jeans fanatic!  I am the type to try on 40 pair of jeans before I find one I think fits just right.  ENJOY!!!  I know I am!"
299,"These are my new favorite boots!  The detailing on them is gorgeous and although they are quite high heels, they have a bit of a platform so I do not feel wobbly at all on them.  I'm really happy with my purchase"
300,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas, he isn't a doctor but I figured he could use them to sleep in-- plus he really likes the show scrubs.  They came ahead of schedule and are really comfortable.  Nice fit on him as well.  I recommend"
301,"We bought these yesterday. They are well made, but kind of thin. Great for spring time, or summer. The color was pink, and it's really bright pink! Very cute style. It fits great, and even has belt loops for my skinny daughter. No elastic waste, but has stretchy material in the back for thicker children. Can wear belt though, if needed. Very cute in style."
302,My 2 year old niece LOVES these shoes.  She is at that very independant stage and throws a fit every time we try to put her in a shopping cart.  These are perfect!  When she walks in a store...we always know where she is.  The best part is that walking in to places everyone looks around to see where the sound is coming from.  People can't help but smile when they see her squeaking along.  Beyond being fun - these shoes are terrific.  They have a nice wide toe box and they are easy to put on.  They are very sturdy and a great value considering many discount stores sell shoes that are higher priced for less quality and that is if you can find the shoes.  These are absolutely the best combination of good value for the money
303,"great pants,large cut allows for shrinkage,wash well,high quality product at a really low price"
304,Good product. The colors are all very similar when held up next to each other so you don't need to order one of each
305,"The collar stays are great!  They came in a convenient little container, and now I'm not searching all over the laundry room floor for the collar stays that fell out of my husband's dress shirts.  The different lengths were helpful because he has different style shirts, and the collar stays came very quickly"
306,These shoes are very comfortable and have a rugged sole.  I use them as business casual shoes as well because they are discreet enough.
307,"I bought this robe and the silk pajamas for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day, both in a size large. The pajamas fit nicely, but the robe was WAY too big! I printed out the return label listing the reason for return as the product did not fit the description online. Amazon said that this was not their fault and deducted the cost of shipping from my refund, and did not offer the opportunity for an exchange. So, now I have to re-order the robe in a smaller size, and the price has gone up $7 since Valentine's Day. This would have been a good deal if it had run true to size, but because of misrepresentations made I will end up paying close to the full price listed. 
MORAL: Order one size smaller than you think you need."
308,When I bought these shoes I didn't know they would look so pretty. I am glad I bought these shoes
309,This is the cutest swimsuit ever!  Very good quality and delivered quickly.  I can't wait for summer!
310,High quality but a little bit pain on the back side if ware it for a very long walk
311,this case is really nice and compact. there is a nice place for a card or x-tra batteries inside. is snuggly fits the HP digital camera. protects well. and well padded. very nice case
312,I run quite a lot - about 1600 Miles a year. Since more than 5 years i'm very happy with the model line of asics gel kayano. Also for marathons it is the best shoe.
313,These socks are wonderful for children with sensitive feet.  My son loves them and he won't wear anything else now.
314,"An incredible thong for the confident man. Extremely sexy, showing off your rear while hiding the essentials back there. Also to the front fits around your package in an incredible way creating almost a seperate pouch for each of the male genitals making an extremely natural fit and feel... except that the curvature will lift and extend your package quite a bit to create a significant effect under clothes and definitely when visable (although the sheerness will negate some of effect). It is quite sheer, extremely so when wet (near nude beach style), so be prepared to be showing off your stuff to that special someone or that nudish beach"
315,I bought a pair for my wife and she told me how warm her feet were while wearing them so I decided to buy a pair for myself. I wear them without socks as they are so warm and comfortable--i think wearing socks w/ these shoes would get a little too warm for my feet.
316,"EEE's are hard to find in slippers.
Bought these and my husband loves them"
320,"Nice and good looking shoe, but you have to be sure what your size is; or you could be annoyed by unfriendly noise under you feet while you walk."
321,"After reading quite a few negative reviews for this bag, I thought I would write a review to clarify something. This is a messenger bag, not a backpack. A messenger bag was and is never meant to hold all the items a backpack can. So basically, if you're using this bag for school purposes, keep this in mind. This bag can hold items for possibly up to 3 classes. So while it's perfect for a college student who might have a class, then another class right after it. This bag would be horrible for a high school student, who might have to drag home texts for six classes.

Of most messenger bags, the Elefunk bag is probably going to be your best choice, cause of its size and number of compartments. We have 3 of these bags, 2 of which are used for education, and the third is used as a utility/diaper family bag. For education, as I stated before, it's best for college students. The main compartment is spans out and can hold 2 college texts, binders, and study guides snug. Keyword there is snug, cause it's not big enough to carry more. Inside the main compartment is a little sleeve held tight by a velcro patch. I use this to keep my study guides from my texts. Okay, next comes the the front pocket attached to the main compartment. This compartment is big enough to fit my 12 inch iBook in a neopreen cover, or a 13 inch MacBook bare. Warning, if you place your MacBook in this pouch, careful how you toss this bag around, cause it offers no padding and is very unforgiving. Inside this front pouch is a zippered sleeve fine for putting loose change or maybe id cards or what not. Next to the zippered sleeve are two pouches for pens and pencils, even a TI calculator, that is if you're not planning on putting your notebook in that pouch. Don't worry though, cause attached to that pouch on the outside are two zippered compartments opposite one another to the front pouch. On one side I put my black leather data file, and on the other side, I put my TI-89 calculator. Then that leaves the flap, which is secured to the bag using strong plastic clips. On the front of the pouch is a zippered compartment. Which I pretty much can only use it to pack up a couple magazines to read, if I'm waiting between classes. You can also use it to pack up headphones or earbuds, to listen to you iPod or whatever. As for the shoulder strap, it's about as comfy as it's going to get. Keep in mind, you're lugging 20 to 30 pounds of books and supplies, it's not suppose to feel like a Chinese massage. But I can't complain.

As for a family bag. Eh, I wouldn't suggest this to a newly mother who wants to go down to a mall. Cause stores will not let your take this bag in there. But if you're on a trip, or going on a flight, this bag is excellent. You can pack away all your babies needs, and other essentials.

Anyway, I just didn't like seeing a product I use, and like, getting knocked, cause a couple people misjudged how to use it properly. Again, if you're taking more than 2 or 3 classes at a time, this bag isn't for you. But if you're a run of the mill college student, who takes a class or two at a time, then goes home. This bag is a must"
323,i realy liked it and it is confortable and attract everybody eyes
324,"These pants come cut to Spec., easy to fit. They are very well made and have held up well through many wearings and Dry Cleanings. Highly Recommended"
326,"No Complaints. Everything ran smoothly. I recommend this seller and this product to everyone. They are absolutely great, and they were exactly as described/pictured"
327,"This is my first Charles by Charles David shoe.  The material is good, the size too. The only uncomfortable issue was the open toe side, but it after 3 days using them it was ok.

Very nice shoe but definetly it is not a $100 dollars one, if you pay less than $50 will be fair"
328,These are very cute shoes.  I love them.  The ties don't stayed tied up around the leg that well once you start walking around.  But they are still great
329,"Great quality item, excellent speedy delivery, very happy to have dealt with this vendor"
330,"When I got these shoes I was afraid that they were unconfortable, but to my surprise they were not! They are just adorable shoes and they look oh-so-sexy too! I truly recommend this product. HYPE makes really nice shoes"
333,"As a 36C runner, this is the best bra on the market. After trying at least 10-15 different sports bras, I will say definitively this is the best bra for running. The bra flattens out the breasts to prevent bouncing. No discomfort at all. No soreness after a run. Best bra -- I highly recommend it! (And I recommend in general buying one size smaller than your everyday bra for a tighter, more secure fit). Happy trails"
334,My boyfriend is now the prettiest man in town.  Who knew pink was his colour
335,"For a price that is lower than what most stores charge for a tie, this vest offers another option for colder days"
336,This was a long over due replacement for the Dopp kit that was given to me when I left for Vietnam. Its changed very little and is still of fine quality. I expect it will provide all the use I'll ever need
337,We received our item well within the time specified.  It was exactly what we ordered.  We are very happy with this service and will use it again
338,"Had a pair of these and they were awesome. Left them in the car one hot summer day and my size 12's now fit my 14 yr old daughter.(Size 8 woman's). Very comfortable, but don't leave in your car on a hot day"
342,Great company to order from... good product and got to me faster than any other order
344,I've had three pairs of these in the last 10 years and I love them.  Note: Be sure to order one whole size larger than your shoe size - for some reason I think they started making them smaller recently.
345,The onesie is very cute & is the exact size I needed. Is a great product for a low price!!! Fast shipping!!
347,"O acabamento do produto raramente é encontrado no Brasil, desde as costuras, qualidade do bordado e detalhes referentes ao time.
Os materiais usados na confecção também são de boa qualidade.
O modelo se encaixa bem na cabeça e é recomendado para quem não gosta dos modelos ""Trucker"", aqueles com a frente enorme"
348,I like the looser fit for outdoor activities and the collar line is just right
349,I had been searching for socks I could wear with my jeans and replace the old athletic socks I was always wearing.  These are the most comfortable socks I've ever owned!  It's like wearing slippers!  I think these socks are spoiling me to the point where all socks will now be compared against these.  I'm afraid I'm becoming a sock connoisseur
350,"I bought a pair of these online last week (against my personal rule never to buy shoes online!) because the price was so good.  I even bought up a 1/2 size to be sure that they would fit.  I own other Clarks shoes, but in my experience clogs tend to run a bit small.  Even buying up a 1/2 size, these shoes are a bit too small and narrow.  I'm going to try to stretch them out and keep them, because they are really cute, but be warned, size up"
352,The product was shipped on time and great condition.  I would recommend this seller to anyone
353,"I had a heck of a time trying to find a bra that would not slip off my shoulders, and would support my breast. This one did both.  This bra supports me better than my sports bra and it gives a beautiful shape to the bustline.  I was looking for a well rounded shape not conical or ski sloped. The key is to get a propper fit.  I went from a 38C to a 34DD not that my sized changed just getting a well fitted bra.  If you can pull the band more than an inch from your body, you are wearing the wrong bra size.  It is supposed to be snug to hold everything in place.  It takes a little getting used to wearing something that tight, but I don't bounce, jiggle or pull up falling bra straps anymore.  I bought two in September 05 and went back and purchased 3 more in October 05, and when these wear out I will purchase the exact same thing.  I hand wash (or machine wash on delicate) after each wearing with a lingerie soap, and line dry.  They still look band new.  I was a little concerned with that itty-bitty plastic front closure bursting, with the band being so snug, but they are still holding ""it all"" together. I was also concerned about the sheer fabric lasting but I haven't had any tears, rips, runs or poked through any of them yet"
354,"These clogs almost did not get to me due to confusing tracking information.  I was so glad that they did arrive and they were truly very comfortable and well made.  However, the leather was kind of stiff that's why I only put a 4 stars.  Overall, I'm happy with them and Clarks shoes always fit me very well"
355,"Great purchase -- good price, easy.  what more could you want"
356,"this hat really wasn't quite what i'd expected...i thought i was purchasing a winter-y sort of knit hat, and it turns out that the front fabric of the hat is actually quite thin, and the back of the hat is that trucker cap type of mesh material. i didn't even notice it in the picture at all, they seemed to angle the hat in the photo so you don't see the mesh back. anyway, it's still a cute hat, i'm just not sure it's worth the money i'd paid for it after discovering what it's really like"
357,I looked for a long time for some cordovan colored penny loafers.  Finally found these.  They fit great and the price was right
358,"I ordered these and a similar pair of Warmbat boots that were 50% off, and I kept the Warmbat's.   These boots are nice - really cute style.  The reason I didn't keep them was that the sheepskin lining just wasn't nearly as soft, thick, and fluffy as the Warmbats - BUT - the Warmbats at full price are DOUBLE the cost.  
These boots were true to size. I wear an 8 or 8.5, and the 8 boot was a perfect fit."
359,"I am a serious swimmer, and I am a great believer in ""Less is Best!"" I know that the Speedo Fastskin full body suit creates an artificial surface that may be faster than bare skin alone, but when the chips are down for the Big Meet, I'll shave down and really zip along with only minimal coverage. Body hair is really a drag. So this Speedo, along with similar low-rider briefs are my favorites.
Please, guys, if you don't have the proper build or are obese and/or have a paunch, DO NOT WEAR THIS or anything else resembling this Speedo!!
Your goal should be to work on your physique so you can safely look great in this wonderful Speedo.
However, if you are in decent condition, then go for it and be proud to show off your body! People will naturally look at you! Women will admire your looks and men will be envious! So there you have it"
360,These shoes feel so great.  They are true to size.  Great for all around use
361,Been wearing them for about 10 years now - never liked the feel of briefs. Hanes boxers fit & feel great. They are nice and baggy with plenty of leg & seat room. They also last a long time & hold up well in the washer. My only advice is to size-UP when you order. I got a 34 waist & only wear size LARGE. Med is too snug . Hanes boxers are classic comfort for the guy that has to feel some slack in the sack
362,"I've been wearing Saucony running shoes for about four years now. This is my first pair of Grid Omni 5 and I'm generally pleased. There is a squeak in the heel of the right shoe, so I contacted the seller and they're going to exchange them for me. First time I've had a squeaking problem with a Saucony shoe. Great stability for a moderate overpronator, very comfortable."
364,It took a while to be delivered but it was well worth the wait!!! A lovely outfit for my baby girl.  I'm 100% in love with it... just sad that I bought it a size larger so I have to wait for her to wear it
365,"These are my single favorite pair of underwear. Not your typical jock but much more comfortable and stylish. I'm in the military so at first I thought ""thongs are not for ""real men"" but after wearing these I found they are, and a lot more guys wear thongs and jocks than you realize. I wear these for every day activivties, sports, work, and leisure. There isn't much fabric so they're great under jeans and my girlfriend thinks there sooo sexy. After wearing them for a while it's like nothing is there because they support you only where you need it. If you've never owned a thong, I think you should give these a shot.I definately recomend the 2xist Y back thong"
366,These are some of the best briefs ive ever worn. I highly recomend these and they are sexy to
367,"One of my favourite adidas shoes.
Definitely the best SLIM sneakers around (also talking about colors)."
368,My leather bag arried this morning and I am so please with it.  It is well made of good quality leather with several pockets and sections to keep me organized.  I love the embossed floral design in the leather.  Shipping was very fast as well.  Thank you for a great product.  Chery
369,The bra is very comfy. It's thin so nursing pads can be seen in certain clothing. But over all great and a great price
371,"I use this bag everyday, and I absolutely love it.  It fit the niche that I needed it to and it could not be better"
373,These shoes are sweet. I also recommend the Garnet B-Ball Shoes.
375,"I am a Matrix fan. When I saw this sunglasses, I knew that I find something special. And now, I can say I was righ. It is a special stuff"
376,"These work pretty well.  Don't waste your money on shipping, go to walmart and look in the lingere section"
377,Item is well made and holds up great.  Was shipped quickly
379,"Very comfortable, great for working out at the gym.  These pants do run a bit small as far as addidas pants go I wish I would have gotten a size bigger"
380,"These have a nice fit.  I recomend them for all occasions, especially campouts, hiking trips, backpacking, or anything else that is active.  These are even cool enough for school locker rooms."
381,"These were replacing the same thing so I knew what I was getting.
Pool side they are the greatest sandals or maybe even just lounging around. Adidas makes pretty good stuff."
382,"I recently got a 15"" MacBook Pro and needed a larger bag to accommodate it (replacing my Manhattan Portage 1640 Waxed Canvas Messenger Bag, which I loved). I ordered and returned several things before settling on this. I am very happy. It is a durable, smartly designed bag, and pretty much a perfect fit for the MacBook Pro, stored inside of a sleeve case. 

At first I thought I would replace my Manhattan Portage bag, which was just barely too small for the MacBook Pro, with the bigger version of the same bag, the 1635. But that bag was WAY too big- the MacBook was swimming in there. This bag is a comfortable fit, with a little room on either side of the MacBook when the bag isn't too full. And there is plenty of room to carry a number of regular books (or whatever else) in addition to the MacBook.

 It also has an ideal number of smaller pockets - not too many, not too few - for storing accessories. For my needs, the pockets are intelligently placed and sized so I feel like there is a place for everything, and I don't feel like there are any useless pockets.  Most of the smaller pockets are inside the main compartment, on the side opposite the one that's against your body when you're wearing the bag. This makes them convenient to access while the bag is on. And one problem I had with the Manhattan Portage bag was that the smaller pockets were on the side that's against your body, so whatever was in the main compartment of the bag would get in the way of accessing the smaller pockets. Since these are on the opposite side, the pockets are easy to get to even when the bag is relatively full. 

One of the pockets has a key ring, but unlike some bags, this one is attached to a long ""leash"", so the keys can actually sit at the bottom of the pocket until you need them. They don't get in the way when you are trying to get other things out, but when you do want them, you just fish them out by grabbing the top of the ""leash"". 

A waterproof liner was an essential feature when I was searching for a bag (I'm paranoid about being caught in a downpour with my laptop), and although this one hasn't been put to the test yet, it seems even better than my previous bag, which always kept the contents dry. One problem with the Manhattan Portage bag was that when the flap was closed there were gaps at the top on both sides, near where the shoulder strap attaches. Although this bag has a similar design, it doesn't seem to have the same problem. 

I do wish this bag came with a shoulder pad for the strap, but that is my only complaint and I'm sure I can purchase one separately. And the price on Amazon is significantly cheaper than I could find anywhere else, so I can put my savings toward the shoulder strap"
383,I ordered these in my regular size (7 1/2) and had to return them to go down a half size.  They are adorable and comfortable--just be aware that they run a little large
384,I've been wearing Olga underwear for many years. These were a nice discovery. I like the wide lace band just below the waist. There are no lines under my clothing
385,I love these jeans. I have worn Levi's all my life and just happend to find these. Same fit. Just as comfortable. Much lower price. Little style details mean nothing to me. Fit and fabric is everything.
386,"This boot is neatly styled, if somewhat undersized. A a good deal for a GOOD PRICE -suggest you order one half to a full size larger than what you normally wear for most comfortable fit"
389,I got this bag 3 months ago and love it. It's much lighter than most luggage bag in it's size category and yet it's body is quite strong and hardy. And the best part is it's low price tag
390,"This Pashmina is soft, warm, and reasonably priced.  The color is a true red, which can be hard to find.  It was a great purchase"
391,"I love this bra.  It is the most comfortable and flattering bra that stays put when you move.  Ideal for smaller breasted women who are happy with how they look.  It is lined so great under t-shirts, and the band is superb"
392,It is just what I was looking for.  Slim but has lots of room for credit cards etc
393,"My husband wears these as his work boots in the kitchen, we had to add some insoles for more comfort but they are holding up well and he really likes the"
394,"The beading on the bag is fantastic, and its very cute.  The color is even more exquisite in person.  It's just big enough to hold ID, a little money, and a lipstick, perfect for going out at night"
395,This is one of the best hats you can buy. I've been wearing western hats for fifty years;and this hat is better than the most expensive
396,I use these socks for running and they are very well cushioned and comfortable. they also withstand frequent laundry without loosing quality.
397,"I purchased the Samsonite Aspire Lite 29"" Expandabe Upright Suiter.  My suitcase is usually very full and close to the 50 lb weight limit with the airline.  Due to the weight of the suitcase, I didn't have to worry about it this time.  My husband has a smaller but heavier Samsonite with very little packed and his weighed in at 48 lbs and mine at 44 lbs.  My suitcase is even larger which is wonderful!  We travel all over the world and now I don't have to sweat during baggage check.  One less thing to worry about"
398,"Look at this shoe!  It speaks for itself, plus it has shimmer and shine and it glitters"
400,"Great price - aprons are perfect for my mom.  She just recently suffered a stroke and I needed inexpensive aprons to easily put over her head for when she eats that look nice and does the job.  The Company sent them out right away; would order again. Just wish they had more colors and designs to choose from.  I order two packages, with 3 in each package"
401,"I could not be more happy with this purchase. The fleece is fantastic, I look the feel and the fit. It is definitely warm and so comfortable! Many people have asked me where I got it, and I have actually sent them the link to purchase it for themselves. I had not ordered from Avalanche previously, but would do it again without hesitation"
402,The picture and description of the bag showed very well. It is a little larger than I thought but it is just fine. I am very satisfied with it and hope to take it on many trips. It also could be a spare diaper bag especially for a Dad
403,These are a lightweight material which is perfect for CA weather.  And my son looks adorable in them
404,"I absolutely love this jacket. I love that I can stuff it into it's own pocket, use it as a pillow or throw it into my pack and carry it, then pull it out and have it ustuffed and on in less than a minute. Design and construction are great and it keeps out wind and water while letting sweat dissipate. I also love the value as it is an excellent product at its price"
405,Product arrived safely within the specified time window.  Thank you very much
406,"This is a truly delightful scarf.  It's very soft and buttery, lightweight, and long.  The drape is incredible.  You can wear it just around your neck or drape it over your head first and it looks stunning.

Initially, I got the winter lilac color, which is actually magenta.  Very pretty color.  I loved it so much, I bought the ivory, black, and cassis (a dark burgundy).  This was a good thing, because my six-year-old daughter cabbaged onto the first one.  Imagine that: A scarf a child actually *wants* to wear.  I love this scarf so much, I'm going to buy the other colors I don't have yet.

We had a very cold, windy winter this year, and I wore one of these scarves every day.  They kept me warm without being oppressively heavy.  They also roll up into almost no space at all, so they're ideal for travel or having in your bag ""just in case.""

The scarf is 100% acrylic, and the one drawback is that it's dry-clean only.  I suspect handwashing would be okay, though.  Even if you have to baby it a bit, it's worth it for the exquisite texture.

I highly recommend this scarf."
407,"I switched to these shoes from the Kayanos as they were getting too expensive, and I had lost some weight (no longer the ""heavy"" runner I was when I had them).  I have been very happy with these shoes.  They are lighter and certainly less expensive than the kayanos.  No injuries.  I had over 490 miles on my previous 1110s before I bought this one.  Still were running well, but I was getting nervous as I used to have to change shoes at 400 miles or my knees would hurt.  I have to say they aren't the most attractive shoes I've ever owned, but they are excellent from a performance standpoint."
408,"The umbrella is everything I was hoping it would be. After using this umbrella, no other umbrella would do for me anymore. Its automatic open feature opens fast despite its big size. 
The layers of silver coating repels the heat and the light from the sun considerably more so than all the other umbrellas I have used in the past.
I can not leave home without it. It easily and neatly folds so it is no hassle to put it inside my handbag wherever I go.
I am getting 2 more for my children"
409,"As a woman, I often have a hard time finding checkbook wallets that aren't meant to be carried only in the purse.  I don't carry a purse -- I keep my wallet in the front pocket of my pants, where it's in easy reach for me, and not so easy reach for thieves.  The Brody Secretary is made of soft, textured leather and fits nicely in my pants pocket.  It holds my cash without needing to fold it, though putting in my checkbook is something of a stretch.  Cards, stamps, receipts, and other necessary bits all fit within the folds with little trouble.

The only real downside is the lack of space for a pen.  With a checkbook inside the wallet, there would be no room at all for an ink pen, meaning I'd still be fumbling around trying to pay for this or that, which was the exact thing I was hoping to avoid"
410,I love this swim suit! It is awesome! Very comfortable and good for those who don't want to wear a 2 peice bikin
411,"This bra provides great support, traps wetness, and is stylish as well. I sweat in the breast area during my workouts and I can't even feel the sweat until I get home and take it off. It also provides great support so you won't get that droopy look under your tees and tanks at the gym. Worth the money for sure."
412,"*Even though this item is currently backordered, do yourself (or your man) a favor and order them now!  Do not miss this great price!

Like the photo implies, and like most 2(x)ist men's products, this underwear is sexy, comfortable, flattering and made of quality materials.

What drew me to this particular pair was the bold graphic statement it makes with the contrast, specifically around the pouch area.  Believe me, it is truly a pouch.  A big one.  Its actually just the right size for me, and I am sure you will have no problem fitting in it/filling it.  The contrast lines around it simply call more attention to your more prized areas, so its really nice.

Of course, the pouch is this size because of the general loss of material elsewhere in the trunk to make this ""no-show.""  I had no problem with this being no show, wearing my lowest-rising jeans with it.  Basically this underwear is meant to be fully appreciated when you are not wearing your pants :)

For me, this trunk was not uncomfortable, given its diminished size and intent to be no-show.  Granted, in those moments of excitement, things do get a little more - eh, crowded.  But a pleasant side effect is that it will look herculean in size if you are only in your underwear.  I did not experience much more discomfort than I did in any other brief/boxerbrief/trunk.

This pair is made of 100% cotton, so those of you who do not appreciate the synthetic materials from the X-Factor line may enjoy this feature.  My only complaint is that the leg openings (also contrast) do not ""cling"" to me as stongly as the waistband since they are not made of elastic or nylon, etc.  But that is just minor.

The waistband is, as always, a remarkably soft material mix and a more discreet height, in keeping with the no-show design.

I cannot reccommend this trunk enough, and within hours, it became my favorite 2(x)ist product in my collection"
413,"I really think sweat pants are only to be worn for the gym, however I found these pants sooooo comfy, that they have become my weekend lounge around the house pants. That being said, my wife is washing them quite frequently. The previous review claims that there was significant shrinkage, however running in a cold cycle wash with a perm press dry cycle has not caused any shrinkage for me.

I recommend these pants 100%"
415,Great boots for a great price! Really warm and comfortable. Come fast. I am very happy with them
416,"I made a bone head move and just bought one. It cost as much to send it as it did for one shirt. These people have areally good t-shirts. Not thin, and they are stiched well"
418,"Super comfy pjs. I know these are supposed to fit snugly, but if you want them to fit a while maybe buy a size larger. Also, just a little bit more girly looking than I expected but still very nice"
419,"I bought the mink color and wear it all the time.  It is a little snug, but it has a good cut and feels tailored.  As soon as the price drops again, I plan to buy it in the other colors too.  I only gave it 4 stars because the craftsmanship is a little lax (lots of hanging threads, etc.) and I am dubious it will hold up after multiples washes, but for the $8.99 that I paid, it is well worth it"
420,"These shoes are another well-spent purchase of Clarks. They are really comfortable and attractive. And with all my other pairs of Clarks, I had to wear them in for a few days so that they would not chaffe my achilles tendon. Warning, wear socks or vband aids for a few days or you won't get too far without blisters. When the shoes wear in, then there are no more blisters and the ride is very luxurious."
421,This is an excellent product.  Would highly recommend.  It looks about three times more expensive than what it costs.  It comes in great packaging with a nice box and a black nylon bag over it.  It also comes with a free small leather card holder.  Makes a wonderful gift
423,It was brand new; packaged well; arrived quickly; husband very pleased with it (Christmas present
424,"They are soft and comfortable.
Tehy feel like I put in inserts inside my shoe.
These are great and cost less"
426,"Great price for NEW sketcher shoes!  Perfect fit, perfect price!  I will do business again with Amazon again and again as long as the service and prices are as great"
427,"these yoga pants are cute and nicely priced. one note: they are quite long, so if you're used to getting high-waters, you'll be pleastantly surprised."
428,"I was looking for a quality boot for my wife. Once again Amazon
came to the rescue. Nine West quality and an incredible discount
plus free shipping.
My wife was thrilled.The boot is beautiful and she tells me
it is incredibly comfortable-- highly recommended"
429,"I am a wheelchair user, and I've been trying to find a shoe that is (a) reasonably heavy, (b) comfortable, and (c) nice-looking.  I like boots, but the boots I have are hard enough to cause me pain from the limited weight on my legs.  Athletic shoes have much more comfortable insoles, but not the weight.  

I was really happily surprised with this product.  It was better than I'd expected.  It's a nice weight -- I can pick my feet up, but the boots help my feet stay on the footrests -- and it is astonishingly comfortable.  

It's pretty easy for me to have problems with things on my feet rubbing the skin off.  While I recognize that walking around in them wuld be more likely to cause a problem, I've just worn them for several days, and I'm not getting sores anywhere.

I'm not really qualified to judge it as a workboot, but it fits my purpose exactly, and I'm quite happy about that"
430,yea ive been an athlete in high school and college. i like the fact that underarmour provides the technology to keep you cool or warm in different temporatures. since i live in cali now the heat gear is something that im enjoying alot. i highly recommend this product to all the people out there who love to work out or are athletes. the product is also comfortable to wear
431,"I have been running for a long time, track in high school and down the road today, and have never had great luck with the way Nikes fit my feet. I was enamored by the Nike+ipod capabilities, almost to the point of buying the 'special' Nikes until I saw this product. The shoe pouch just straps into your shoelaces. It's great to be able to put on the shoes that are most fitting and get the benefits of the Nike+ program as well."
432,"I am so in love with these jeans. I made myself a promise that when I buy jeans again, these are definitely the brand jeans I will be purchasing!! I am very pleased with the L.E.I. jeans to the full extent!!"
433,These are very nice and comfortable. The even have extra arch support. These are just as nice as the Deerskin but with the added support.
434,"I just got these sneaks recently.  I am going through the wear-in phase of the shoes.  So these opinions are based soley, no pun intended, on my time with them so far.

Originally I had gotten a pair of the Jordan Hoops Low.  I loved the style and got a good deal on them.  Well, I found out that 13 in Jordan is more like 11 or 12 in other shoes.  So I had them returned for a 14. I got the 14's and they were long enough..just not wide enough.  It was then that I found out most of the Jordan b-ball shoes are pretty thin width.  

I told the guy that I am willing to look at what they have in the store to just get something that I can try on.  I ended up trying the KG A3 and they felt nice.  I tried on these T-Mac 6s next and they feel better than the KGs overall.  The KGs felt better on the heel, but that was the only place.  Everywhere else, the T-Macs are more comfortable and it is the perfect width.

Just on the shoe...they are hurting my feet just a bit..but that is common for me for the break in period.  I am overweight and flat footed so it takes a while for me to get my shoes comfortable.  They are also warm inside. I am just wearing normal cotton socks right now, not my new Jordan dri-fit socks which wick better. I notice that there are no ventilation holes on the the shoe like most have.  None on the toe area..none on the tongue..and none on the sides.  There is also no meshy fabric to help ventilation either.

One thing I worry about is the ""stability system"" on the bottom of the shoe.  Long term..it seems like it would be like the Shox system.  My local shoe expert says he gets many returns for Shox that have been torn or worn at the Shox part prematurely but never had any T-Macs back yet.  I guess we will see"
435,"I don't spend a lot on sunglasses because I destroy them regularly. I bought these as they were in the right price range for a ""disposable"" item. These are as good as you can expect for this price. They are relatively well made out of decent grade materials. They were a little tight on me, so I bent them out a touch, and now they are comfortable. These are a good value"
436,"These shoes are so light that sometimes I forget I have them on. They are so  comfortable than I don't want to take them off. I have to walk a lot every day and I am not kidding when I said that any other pair of shoes make my feet sore after a few hours of use, but these shoes do the job to perfection. 
I highly recommend them"
437,My son loves the backback and the spacious room for he has for all the engineering books he needs for class
439,"I have purchased these tights at a store(for like [...] bucks). I like them, they are thick but not not to hot or itchy. The great part is they do not roll down at the top and you cant see like my little girl underwear comming out the side of the leotard with the tights.My little girl is 3 years old, she's not really tall but she is about an inch taller than all the other children. So I got the Small (the worker in the store told me it would fit),
the sizes run like this:
Toddler 2T-4T        34""-40""
Small    4-6             40""-46""
Intermediate 6x-7   46""-51""
Medium 8-10          51""-55""
Large 12-14            55""-60""

over all it is good, the only reason why I did not vote it as an 5 star is because I only used them once but next week we will be using them again. So if you are looking for ballet tights buy online because the price is good!!! Unless you got a different source"
441,"Best show I have ever worn. Wear them 14hours / day every day. Water proof, warm in winter, cool in summer. Best price I have ever found was from Amazon (1/3 off) regular price"
442,"I really like the look of these panties all lacy and feminine. They feel good on, look great and best of all, they're low cut so you can were them with your jeans riding low on your hips. And if a bit of panty does peek out all the better, cuz these are so cute. Pretty darned enticing too, if you know what I mean"
443,I have purchased several shoes from Nine West and for the price these are very comfortable boots and of good quality. I would highly recommend them because they are the kind of boot you can wear all day long. The calf of the boot is very generous and the heel height is exquisive for walking in fashion.
444,The reading glasses are both fun and functional but the service and people make any purchase with this company well worth trying.  I would recommend checking out goggle just for the service.
445,"I bought these shoes in my usual size and had to exchange them for a half size smaller... They are great shoes, but they run big!"
446,Got what I ordered on time and delivered directly to my niece.  Would have been nice to have gift wrap option thoug
447,This thermal top is thin but warm. It fits comfortably under any type of shirt. It has 2 layers without the bulk of other thermals. Not much shrinkage after washing in hot water
448,"My armband is just the right size for the opening,I think the other user tried to put the clip end in instead of the other side like you are supposed to.  This is a well worth the price.  I have not seen this style out there.  I like all the color options.  The armband works great for working out"
449,Wanted a small size earmuff not the MEGA muffs. Old style over the top of the head. Sent quickly and good price
450,"This is already my second set because I love them so much.  I've been using them on my two year old daughter since she started solids. They are lightweight, easy to clean and catch everything.  They last forever and come in great patterns."
451,"These slippers fit perfectly, more like a very comfortable shoe than a slipper.  They are attractive, well made and a genuine bargain. Probably not for the very wide foot"
453,"I bought a ""sheer"" jersey t-shirt in Apricot and another in Light Blue, both size Medium. I really like the light weight, stretchy, and soft fabric of both tees, but the cuts are inconsistent. The Apricot is very baggy, and the blue is form-fitting, which I prefer. Incidentally, neither shirt is even close to sheer, they are just light weight fabric, and cooler and more comfortable than standard heavy duty t-shirts."
455,"If you are the kind of person who can't stand a big wallet this is for you. Surprisingly you can fit a good amount in this and it is no bigger than a credit card. Right now I have 6 bills, 2 credit cards, license, and a few business cards."
456,"I can't get over how good I look in this. I just stared at my reflection in the mirror. I almost wanted to make love to myself right then and there. This three piece proves that you don't have to show it all to be very, very sexy"
459,"great little gift given with a tie, the price was exceptiona"
460,"Great wallet, plenty of credit card slots, lightweight, the only thing missing at the moment is money to fill it with"
461,"Perfect fit for 2nd. gen Nano.
Rubber protection inside keeps the iPod well protected.
The screen protection ""glass"" is cristal clear and matches the screen size perfectly.

Very good product"
462,Great boots.  Perfect for playing in the rain.  Great Quality.  I bought one size bigger that current size so they would last at least two rainy season.  No problems for the kiddos to adjust to bigger size.  We previously had the frog boots and they are still in great shape to be hand-me-downs
463,"I got this bra at a deeply discounted price when it was on clearance at a nearby store, and I didn't realize how much I liked it until I decided to buy another one some time later, and panicked when I couldn't make out the writing on the tag.  I have been trying to find this dang bra for AGES! Finally! I found it again! I am so stoked!  The one I bought so long ago is my favorite bra, and it looks pretty sad by now.  Like other reviewers' bras, mine developed a split in the fabric, but it was only after many, many washes in the machine, rides on the bike, exercise DVDs, naps, etc.  

I like this bra because it fits me so well, but also because the fabric is so breathable--no cotton, so it dries fast!  It is really stable so I actually use mine instead of a sports bra, because sports bras suck.  If I could, I would people the lingerie world with these bras. The only problem a lady might have with this bra is sheerness-related:  Don't wear it with a sheer shirt!  I wish there were another version, ""Opaque Tapestry,"" maybe.  Then I'd never buy any other bra"
464,"OK, I admit it. I was a bit skeptical about ordering this shirt because it looked kind of tacky in the photos. But since it was on a Friday sale, I ordered the Asian Pear color, which is really a light beige or tan (I thought it might be kind of greenish, but no). 

I'm 5'8"", 135 lbs, with broad shoulders and long arms. I ordered a medium. And I'm wearing it right now. The sleeves are plenty long enough, and there is a generous amount of 'give' in the shoulders. I'd say that this shirt almost runs true to size, although a medium certainly doesn't hug me like the medium-sized Brandon Thomas grommet jacket does. A large size in this shirt would have been far too big for me. I probably could have gotten away with a small, but I like this shirt being bit loose. I can wear a shirt underneath it without it being too snug.

The quality of the shirt (which could really be used as a light jacket) is quite good. It isn't lined, but it is soft to the touch and warm. It snaps closed, so no loose buttons to worry with. 

I like it! It isn't tacky-looking in person, but it's definitely different. If it goes on sale again, I will buy another color"
465,"I researched this thouroughly before buying. I wanted a nice looking case that would protect the entrie thing with little extra space added to my iPod. This case does all of that. I got the red (blaze) color, and I love it.  It even feels good to the touch. I did cut out the space for the hold switch and the area around the headphone port, but I don't see that as any sort of problem. i just got my iPod today and have already dropped it, but I feel safe and secure knowing that I have my evo3 case on my beautiful iPod. Definitely worth the price"
466,"Munsingwear briefs are the most comfortable I have ever worn.
For many years they seemed to be unavailable -- and as a
result I have been ""uncomfortable.""  Am glad they are being
manufactured again, and that the quality is as good as (or
maybe even better than) before.  I slightly prefer the boxer
brief in cold weather and the regular brief in warm weather"
467,"I love my new Reebok Princess tennie runners.  They are comfortable beyond a shadow of a doubt, fit perfectly with heavy socks - why I bought 1/2 size larger than my normal shoe size - and I will keep coming back to Reeboks for the remainder of my years.  I have always worn Reeboks because I have a very high arch, and they are the only shoe manufacturer which takes people's feet and the shapes of same into consideration.

Happy New Year for 2007; may we see a better year throughout the world"
468,"Okay, this cap is really stylish. But I think the sewing isn't quite finished. There were loose threads all over my caps when I got them. Not to mention the parts that weren't even sewed... no threads at all"
469,Very nice shirt.  Order the adult small for my 12yr old son.  Fits very well
470,Very warm. The only inconvenience I see with these is that strong winds make them feel as if they are going to fly away! Otherwise good product
471,These umbrellas are incredible!  They remind us of the ones we picked up in London
472,"I bought this because I needed something to run in as well as use as an ""all around light weight jacket""  This does the trick, very light, great in the rain. I am very pleased with the product and the customer service was top notch"
473,"I'm only 5'4"" and these pants are perfect!  Not too long and soooooo comfy.  Not too tight, hang just right, soft, and I love Happy Bunny stuff, and this one doesn't have a specific saying so I can wear any top with 'em.  Of course, I've only worn them to bed so far, but I'm pregnant, too and these are gonna be comfortable to wear the whole time, I can tell"
474,My granddaughter loves the message on this shirt.  She says it still looks good after a few washes
475,This is really really warm and comfortable especially during cold temperatures. I ordered several of these shirts and they have become favorites.  I love this shirt!
476,"I bought these shoes in black and wore them for the first time today with a simple black skirt and blouse for the office.  For the first wearing, they were very comfortable and really good to look at.  I am definitely pleased with the quality and value!"
477,my fav shoes- I can wear them to dress up or to dress down... the review about how to adjust the slasp was very helpful to
478,Fits perfectly and the hold lasts all day (doesn't loosen up). Wouldn't recomment sleeping with this bra on
479,These are great; they're comfortable and great for showing off.  Definitely buying some more pairs
480,"I originally bought the Case Logic Quick-Lock 320 CD case... as soon as I got it home and loaded it up with CD's, I knew it just wasn't going to work, moving pages around was a huge hassle, you had to remove EVERY page first, and putting them back in wasn't easy...

So...I went with this case. It's binder style, so at the very least I knew I would be able to organize pages easily.

This is a good case overall. The zipper seems good, the binder seems strong, but the handle is a flimsy piece of rubber stitched to the nylon. I bought this case is for storage and not hauling it around so that doesn't matter too much. 

 I filled it to capacity and to my surpise there is no room to add pages... Also, as with any large capacity binder, flipping pages is not a smooth action, you have to guide the page up and over, and it's hard to flip over any more than 5 pages at a time.

In Summary:
Pros: stylish, built well, good quality pages (the CD never has  to slide over plastic)

Cons: No room for additional pages, hard to flip pages, flimsy rubber handle

I did A LOT of shopping around for a CD case, I'm satisfied this case is better than all the rest I've looked at, but I just think it's possible for all these companies to build a better CD case"
481,Shipping was excellent.  The shoe wears well.  Very stylist for pants and suits.
482,Ordered this brand and size without prior exposure to product. They fit perfectly and are great quality. Not as sturdy as Keen's but more aesthetically pleasing. Great for walking or exercising.
483,Great customer service.  My father & husband loved the foot comfort.
484,"These shirts are nice, soft and a bit sheer.  They are perfect for wearing under your clothes for an extra layer of warmth when it's cold.  They are long enough to tuck in.  I'm a size 8-10 and the medium fits me snuggly.  The V-neck is a great shape.  It sits low enough so that it doesn't show, but is high enough to give good coverage.  The pink is a nice color for undergarments - a soft, pale peachy pink.


My order was shipped from Bare Essentials.  The box arrived the next day and it was just after a snow and ice storm!  The items were packed femininely with logo tissue.  I appreciated that the vendor also included a form for convenient return of the items and included an 800 number for questions.  I've ordered items on Amazon through Boscov's and have had a difficult time contacting Boscov's."
485,This is a great product.  It is well made and just the right size for books and other items.  The fabric is thicker than a the regular nylon and you can tell it is a high quality product. I really like the extra convenience of the outer pocket. It allows you to carry smaller stuff that would otherwise get lost at the bottom of the bag.
488,YOU CAN RUSSELL AROUND WITH THESE TEES AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY THEYRE VERY HIGH IN QUALITY AND PRICED RIGHT .I HAVE BOUGHT 20 OR SO OF THESE .THEY REALLY HOLD UP WELL
489,"It's unbelievable that you don't get these for free with the Zen. But, that aside, buy these now. You're going to want them right away to protect the screen. And, the other reviewer is right about putting them on. If you're not careful, when you're squeezing out the bubbles with your nails, you can scratch the protector screen you just applied. So, try to be careful"
492,"For years I've been buying JanSport bags for school and to use on trips. This bag I just got to help me through my Sophmore year of High School. I love JanSport because they have sturdy bags, that can last being packed to the brim with books, and shoved down bleachers, you know, typical high school stuff. It is also great for going up in the mountains, cause when you kick it down a cliff, it won't bust! YAY!!!!! This back rocks my socks, and you can decorate it with pins and patches and stuff to make it your own, I would recommend it everyone"
493,"These shorts are really nice, my son loves them. They fit him well and are very comfortable. Even though they are not a name brand I see no difference. Would buy again. Thanks."
494,"the fit is perfect, fun yet conservative! the fabric is breathable and not sheer, it is apropriate for dance or ther aerobic activities, and also it can be worn under pants or as i shirt or as a camisole, IT IS STUPENDOU"
495,"These boots are warm and comfortable, like my sheepskin slippers.  My feet are toasty, even when it's freezing outside.  They have a thicker sole than some other styles, which makes this boot great for walking in snow and ice.  I love the warm brown of the chestnut.  They look great!  At 50% off, the price was great, too"
496,"These really do work!  Once you've got them on right (it took me a couple tries, but then I got the hang of it) they really STAY on and do the job wonderfully.  They do hurt a bit taking them off (I've found that if you take them off in the shower it helps, much like a band-aid) but otherwise they're very comfortable to wear, and I always forget I even have them on.  They're a god-send for today's tight-fitting fashions"
497,"I dare say these are just about the sexiest things I've ever worn. Oh I've had and have G-strings, have some pretty skimpy ones too. But a crotchless G-String, masqurading as a crotchless pantie, what a concept. Try going outside in a short skirt with nothing under it but these. Might as well be walking around naked under that skirt. But then again I've done that. However, wearing these panties slash G-string just seems sexier than naked"
498,I really am enjoying this product it is helping me stay organized and prepared for classes
500,"There is nothing that makes feel sexier than wearing a crotchless panty under your clothes. This wonderful piece of lingerie is comfortable enough to wear all day long, and yet look super sexy when revealed. Combine this with the Portrait Open Tip Bra, and you have the kind of outfit that will drive him crazy. I love playing the hottie in this panty, and highly recommend it to you"
501,"I've always worn boxers but when I tried these on, I thought they were so comfortable that I went back to wearing briefs.  Now I wear them all the time, and for all occasions.  Plus, they are perfect just to lounge around in"
502,"This bag is great for people who need a lot of organizing space for their gym stuff. Lots of pockets, yoga mat holder is great, bottle holder fits all standard sized gym and water bottles. The only con is that if it is not filled, the bag tends to fall on itself"
503,"My son wears shoes out fairly quickly and these are holding up well to all an almost 3 year old can dish out.  The velcro also makes it possible for him to dress himself, which he likes, and provides a good fit"
504,I like these boots so much my mother ordered a pair really cute with jeans or dress pants. really comfortable and well made
506,"Good quality workmanship, very authentic looking and sizes are easy to fit. 

I would buy another one. 


robert"
507,"I own 2 pairs ...They are classy and go with everything,but the only minus point is that they are a bit heavy...but you eventually get the hang of it"
510,"I bought these little cute shoes for my 1 yr old. I love them, my son can only walk with these because of their soft sole, I highly recommend them for kids under 2 yrs of age. I will buy the next size up.
Great shoes, thanks Komfort Kid"
511,"i love the tulip hem on this, and it fits great. the corduroy is such a fine wale it's almost velvety. gorgeous! runs quite long if you're petite-- almost ankle-length.
size seems to run a teeny bit big; i ordered a 6 and it's definitely comfy, if not loose, and i'm usually an 8."
512,"they fit like I would expect a size medium to fit, so I was satisfied; I will definitely buy the Badger brand again; I was only disappointed because it is not sold in retail outlets"
513,"I always have a hard time with my 17 year old son, finding long pants that are durable and yet comfortable enough to compete with his soccer shorts.  Length is always an issue for us, since he's 6'6"" with 36"" inseam.  These cargo pants were perfect!  They are well made, durable, long enough and have drawstrings both at waist and ankle for size adjustment.  Plenty of cargo space for cell phone, keys, wallet and more.  I ordered 3 pair and am glad I did"
514,"This is a product that every breastfeeding mother needs to know about. Finally a solution to leaking and a way to sleep without wearing a bra! I've been using lilypadz for about a month now and I must say that I LOVE them. When I started breastfeeding my daughter I was using the traditional round cotton pads that you have to put inside your bra to soak up leaks. I hated them because they look terrible under a snug fitting shirt, they don't always absorb all the liquid, and they can shift out of position leaving you with no protection at all. I assumed it was just a necessary evil to breastfeeding because I didn't know something as wonderful as lilypadz existed!

I have to admit, when I first saw them advertised I was skeptical. I didn't think they would stick, I didn't think they would stay in place, and I thought for sure if they did stick that it would hurt to take them off or they'd leave a tacky residue on my breast. I hestitated for a couple of weeks, wanting to try them, but afraid that I'd spend all that money and end up disappointed. It was one morning after waking up soaked because one of my cotton pads slipped during the night I decided I would risk it and order them. 

When they arrived I read all the instructions and was ready to try them out. Now this is the embarrassing part... in the instructions it specifically says to take them off the plastic dome before using. For some reason I thought they meant take them out of the plastic container. I didn't realize that EACH lilypad was also stuck on a piece of plastic!  When I first tried to put them on I actually tried flipping the entire pad and the plastic dome inside out. (yes it was tough to do too!!) I was frustrated because they obviously didn't stick. I began to think that my fear of them not working was true. Once I realized my stupid mistake, I peeled them off the plastic and tried again. They stuck perfectly!! Try and avoid having the problem I did.. make sure you peel each of them off their little plastic domes. 

I was immediately surprised at how secure they felt. I knew right away that I would be able to wear them to bed and not have to worry about one falling off. My next fear was removing them. I carefully lifted up an edge and peeled one off. I was surprised that even though they stuck securely, they peeled off with ease and without causing pain to my tender breasts. I was estatic! What a great product!!

I have found after using them for about a month that there are pros and cons. However the pros greatly outweigh the cons. This is what I have found...

PROS
------
1) Attaches securely
2) Removes with VERY little or no pain
3) No residue left behind on the breast. Baby can eat as soon as a pad is removed. 
4) Protects tender breasts from rubbing against clothing or sticking to cotton pads. (If you are feeling sore these are a HUGE help.)
5) Secure enough to stay on all night long without wearing a bra. 
6) Washable and reusable
7) Invisible under snug fitting shirts. 
8) When properly applied you will not leak
9) Peace of mind 
10) Quick drying. After cleaning them give them a good shake and you are ready to reapply them (even if they are a bit damp still). No need to buy more than one pair unless you need the peace of mind of a back up. One pair will work and will always be ready to use. 

CONS
-------
1) If not properly applied you might leak. You must be careful to avoid air bubbles and make sure you apply strong pressure to the nipple when putting them on. However, even if you leak - it won't get on your clothes. Instead it pools up around the nipple. It usually stays sealed. You just have to be sure to remove the pad, drain the liquid, rinse them and then reapply properly. One warning, if you have an air bubble and you leak A LOT it is possible for the pad to loosen and pop off spilling milk on you. This has only happened to me maybe twice after a long night of leaking while sleeping. I leaked during the night, woke up and was feeding the baby from one side without checking to see if I had leaked on the other. My milk let down filling the air bubble more and the pad popped off drenching me.
2) If you own cats/dogs... keep them AWAY from the pads when you aren't wearing them. They attract fur like crazy. If they do get furry its OK because it does wash off. Its just a pain in the butt and takes a little extra effort
3) Takes a little more effort to reapply the pad in public (vs shoving a cotton pad back in your bra) but once you get the hang of it, it woudn't even make the con list anymore.
4) I personally don't wear them every day. I'm one of those types that thinks skin should have a chance to breathe a little. I DO wear them every night, but during the day I'll occasionally wear my  cotton pads so my skin can breathe. I'm afraid that I'll end up with thrush or just pruney nipples if I wore them 24/7. I have no evidence to back up the claim - they may work just fine 24/7. I'd say I wear them 3-4 times a week during the day. I will NOT go a night without wearing them though because I hate wearing a bra to bed. 

As you can see the pros outweigh the cons by quite a bit. The cons shouldn't be enough to keep you from trying them yourself. Even if you plan on wearing them only at night they are well worth the cost. If you are like me and you are skeptical - don't be. These really do work and you will be glad that you gave them a try. Every breastfeeding mother should own a pair and I think they would make a WONDERFUL and unique baby shower gift!"
517,"This item is the most comfortable thing you could ever put on. 
Please be advised if you need support and plan to wear it in public..you will not have much support."
518,"These are very nice gloves. The leather is a good quality and the silk is very comfortable. I would buy more of these if I needed more. I don't like their cashmere lined gloves however, as the cashmere is rough--mine from Neiman's are really nice, so I had high hopes for those from this source, but it didn't pan out. The silk lined are great though"
519,"I love this boot!  They are cute, warm, and comfortable.  After reading another happy customers review, I did decide to order a half size larger.....the boots do run small."
520,"We purchased this (size small)  hat for our soon to be 4 year old daughter. The fit is perfect for a small child and even allows for room to grow since it has the elastic band inside. I can see her still wearing this at age 6 or 7 even. The material is stiff but it IS a ""straw"" cowgirl hat. My husband's cowboy hat is the same way and is also a straw hat. If you want soft material your best bet is a crushable fleece one. 
[...] We were thrilled it matches her boots and saddle perfect."
521,The PJs by Carole were an excellent choice. I had checked around for PJs that were light-weight flannel and attractive at the same time. The two sets of PJs from Carole fit the bill entirely. I've been using them every night since they arrived. And they can be thrown in the washer and dryer and still look and feel great. They are the most comfortable PJs I have ever owned.
523,"It was more comfortable than I suspected. My husband had a positive response which was good, I was defenitly satisfied with the product"
524,"I LOVE ALL MY PRODUCTS FROM AIMEE GOWNS, THE ROBE, PJ'S AND GOWN. GREAT PRODUCTS, THANK YOU"
526,"I purchased these shoes for my son's basketball season and he loves them.
The colors matches his uniform which looks great and they have great support and comfort. Not to mention they are very reasonably priced. 
I would definitely recommend these shoes to other mothers and sons!  Karen Peterso"
527,I have worn boxers for a number of years now and I was looking to try something new so I decided to give these a shot.  I was pleasantly surprised with their comfort and support.  I also found the material to be very strong despite its lightweight.  I would definitely recomend these bikini briefs for anyone who is looking for something other than just boxers or briefs
528,"Excellent buy for the money.  Nice quality fabric, ingenious construction.
Great to have in the car, for traveling or camping."
529,"These square cut Puma trunks will get you hot looks at the beach if you have a good physique. Very comfortable and way better tan lines than board shorts. Puma logo is big enough to be noticed and will definitely garner comments especially on a beach full O label ho's LOL. Have fun, be happy and don't be a hater."
531,"This is a really comfortable shoe.  I would definatly recommend it to anyone who needs to look professional while walking a lot.  I have to walk outside, up and down hills and this shoe feels like a sneaker.  The heel is not too high and it has great cushion.  I have been wearing it for a couple of months and it still is in great shape.  Great buy"
532,The case arrived in time for Christmas and was just what we ordered.  It was a gift and the recipient was please with the quality of the item
534,"I just got my DS for Christmas and needed a case.  I decided to buy this one because it's the same one my 2 friends have (They got theirs to match their DSs, so naturally I had to do the same).  I like that it has a pocket inside to hold games and extra styluses.  It keeps everything in one place, looks great, and is pretty high quality.  I highly recommend it"
536,I love this bra ... just the right amount of support.  Order arrived 4 days before expected ... woo hoo!!
539,"I hate the cold.  I mean I really HATE it, after getting frost bite on my nose and ears.  However, I try not to let it slow me down.  I run except in the coldest weather (like now its almost 0F with the wind chill).

Whenever the temperature drops to 40F or less, I wear these and my running shorts.  I can wear them to about 60F, then I overheat and have to shed them.  They are great except the fit;  they were too small in the quads, so I chose a XXL.  When the weather gets very cold (25F to 10F), I layer additional clothing on top, wind pants, jeans, whatever. 

See my Smartwool reviews about other cold weather gear that I wear"
540,"I have enjoyed Reef sandals for years due completely to their comfort.  In recent years I've started enjoying them for their functionality as well.  Last year I bought a pair of the Reef Fanning's which integrated a bottle opener in the heel.  Well, this year they took it one step further and integrated a flask into the heel.  I love these sandals.  Not only are they comfortable, with or without liquid in them, they also have the added flask function.

Of course, it's mostly for novelty in my case because it's not often I need to carry around 3 ounces of liquor in my shoes but for those times when I do, or just want to for fun, it's great that I can"
541,My wife had one just like this for 15 years and it was time for a new one. This back is almost identical and better quality. Shipping was very fast and it came exactly as I expected
542,"These runners are great.
I wear custom-made hard orthodics and the insoles pull out of these shoes and fit full length orthodics and are deep enough to where my heel doesn't slip out of the back of these shoes...good for serious runners"
543,"No break-in, comfort from the first wearing. I recommend them highly"
544,A great sweatshirt all around!  Had it a year and still holding up very well.
545,"I purchased this ID Holder/Key Chain in the green color.  It is a very nice color green. The leather is smooth to the touch. I also purchased the more expensive black CLAVA ID Holder/Key chain as a gift for a man. If color isn't an issue, stick with the less expensive.  The black was nearly double in cost and it is IDENTICAL in appearance and feel. I am very pleased with the green color. It is a dark green and is very nice. (It would have worked great for the man I purchased it for, had I known what the green looked like) I love this ID/Holder Key Chain bc along with carrying my keys with it, I can carry a lot of things inside such as my Drivers License, credit cards, insurance cards, photos, membership cards, money, receipts, etc. One of the inside ID holders also has a zipper pocket attached so you can also carry loose change. The ID holder also velcros closed, which is a nice feature. There is also one clear plastic pocket on the outside which works perfectly for displaying a photo of my children. I don't think I'd use the outside pocket to hold my drivers licence or another valuable card for fear that it may fall out and get lost. Also, I like carrying my keys with the ID Holder bc I don't have to worry about driving to the store and running in to realize that I forgot my wallet in the car or at home. I like the convenience of having it all together. This is a great buy! Especially for college students. I was first introduced to this style ID holder in college and have been using it ever since"
546,I gave this pajama as a gift. The snow bears are cute. Is good for the whole year
547,Being average size this gaff has power of hidding the bulge... It holds and tucks the genitals from falling out... to be able to look down and see a flat bikini...
548,Jersey is great.  price was great and my son loves it!!! What more could I ask for!
549,The ear warmers arrived on time and the kids love them.  They keep there ears nice and warm
550,"A cuter more feminine version of the ever-popular clunky crocs.  Love mine!  Comfortable, versatile, and last forever.  Good support.  And in the hot AZ summer, the airholes help keep my feet cool"
551,"Love this Kept Couture Toiletry Kit. I actually own two of them and give them as gifts during the holidays to my friends. The bag has a vinyl liner which is extremely helpful when your shampoo bottle leaks during travel. It keeps the leaky goods all inside - won't ruin the other stuff in your suitcase. And, it's a perfect size. It can hold about 10 days' worth of toiletries."
552,"I am happy with this bag (I got the pink and white one). It is a lovely color, nice size, durable and good price. It comes with an outside pocket and I received it quickly. My only complaint is that almost $7 in shipping is being charged for a light tote that was $3.99, otherwise I highly recommend this bag."
553,I was very happy with my last order. It was easy to order and didn't take long to get the product. My grandson was a very happy little boy on christmas morning. Thank you so much for the great services.I will use amazon again and tell my friends about i
554,"This item is not any fancy tech gadget, just did what it said, transmit FM signal on all frequencies between 87.5 & 108.0. Practically it is a bit combersome if your cigarette lighter is in a tight space, for me, my drink holder cannot open if this is in use. Functionality is pretty simply, just three buttons, On/off , UP and Down(for frequency tuning). No programming functionality.

PRO: Does exactly what it says it does. Has a USB port to power other devices(cellular phone, PDA etc)

CONS: No programming functionality, some cars would not have enough space, some feedback on the frequencies(this may not be the fault of the device) probably noise in atmosphere,"
556,"These slippers are really sharp looking.  I purchased them as a gift for a male relative who's a big Cardinals fan.  My only watch-out is the sizes.  I ordered a size large, which was supposed to fit his size, but I had to re-order an XL because his heels were hanging off the back"
557,"I was never one for thongs, g-strings or jocks because they never felt comfortable and gave me the coverage I like.  These CK hip briefs are great to wear under my shorts while I'm running or playing volleyball.  They don't ride up and I like the fact that they support both my package upfront and my bubble butt as well.  They're good for when I'm playing sports or just wearing under my jeans when I'm going out - they're one of the only sport briefs that not only look good but give perfect support and comfort - and I'm told they look really sexy so I'm going to buy more"
558,"thanks so much

I bought these glasses and they had a minor defect. They responded to my email very quickly and I was send another pair within days. 

Would definetly do business with again, THANKS!!"
559,I have worn Sauconys for years and this is my most comfortable and supportive pair yet
560,"As soon as my order cleared the manager called me to verify the color and sizes I wanted.  He was professional and friendly and told me when to expect the hoodie and the pants.  I recommend getting the set.  This is amazingly comfortable and flattering- pants look great on the butt!  I recommend getting different sizes if you are smaller on top - it looks cuter.
Very cute set! I will be getting more in different colors"
561,I do like these boots but I have had better fleece boots for standing all day in. I work as a bank teller and after standing all day the boots don't offer much support. They still feel comfortable but a like the padding has been mashed down. Not as comfy as when I first bought them. As far as warmth they are great. Enough sheerling to stay warm but not get too hot when it's warmer outside.
562,"I am currently living in Vilnius, Lithuania. We have a Bandolino store next door to us. Just by chance I ordered the boots on Amazon and had them sent to my U.S. address.
Now..to the point. They are great!!!! I wear size 8 1/2 but ordered size 9 since it is necessary to ""sock up."" The boots are beautiful and more importantly..fit like a glove.
This is great since my feet have always hurt when I walked a block or two. I intend to order more. By the way....the boots ""on sale"" next door cost 10 times the amount I paid.
Enjoy.
susa"
564,These do promote a more stable stride especially on slick surfaces.  I only buy Propet for walking shoes.  They are quality made.  My only disappointment was the sizing.  They run wider in the heel and toe than other shoes I've purchased from them in the same size
565,"I like to carry my cash in my pocket when possible. A purse is a pain. So this is very nice for a few bills and lots of coins. It's a bit of a bear to open until you understand how. You open at the sides rather than squeeze. So it doesn't actually work the way it's designed to --- at least not well. But that's a small issue and this is a nice, well made product that should last a long time. It's easy on the pocket --- no bulge. And it's handy"
566,"Rapid shipping, good quality, items were as represented"
567,"The pants seem to be good quality, fit well, comfortable, easy to wash, durable, reasonably priced.  We are very satisfied with this purchase"
568,"I love Clarks. They are the best fitting shoes I have ever worn. They
never hurt my feet and I have to be careful with me feet because I am
a diabetic. You can't go wrong with Clarks. I try to buy my Clarks on
Amazon because I can get such good prices"
569,I can't give you a professional review on these but my daughter is 7 and she hasn't taken them off since Christmas she dances as she walks in the kitchen and to her room. She wears a size 1 and I got her a size 2 they are a little big but there are pull strings to form them to your feet so they snugged down nice
570,I bought a pair for my husband and son.  They both seem happy with the comfort factor and I think they are cute.  I think they could use a bit more of a cushion
572,these sandals are as comfortable as they are beautiful.  the color is a soft gold that can be worn with many different outfits and the material is soft against the foot
573,Very confortable shoes (even though it takes a few days to adapt the shoes to your feet). The fact that it has a rubber soil makes it useful in wet surfaces and in the snow. For this price is a very good product and I highly recommend it if you want some good shoes by a low price
575,"These are the best shoes! They are the first pair I could keep on my son's feet. Other shoes have very hard soles and are difficult for new walkers. The Komfort Kidz shoes are soft enough for new walkers, but thick enough to handle the elements from walking outside. I tried Robeez, but I didn't like the way they seemed thin, plus he would kick them off. He actually likes wearing these! He will hand them to me to put on his feet. Great product! I wish they had a few more styles though. I am on my 2nd pair of the same shoe and I am sure I will get another pair when he goes up a size"
576,"I searched all over town for Crocs for my little man (size 4 1/2) with no luck. The smallest size they come is size 6-7 (obviously way too big) except for the Disney style. They are a little more expensive, but worth it. They are so easy to put on & take off, and they look so cute on him. I was worried that the color might be too bright, but they're not & they look great with most of his outfits! People stop us all the time to ask where we got them...I have yet to see them in a store, but I will be buying another pair in red & black from Amazon"
577,"LOVE THESE SHOES!!!

They are lots of fun to wear, VERY comfortable, and I have received TONS of compliments on them.  Buy them"
578,This robe is so comfortable. I use it to stay warm in the evenings.
579,I have been wearing these around the house for 2 days to test the comfort and fit.  They are very comfortable and cute too!  They are a bit stiff out of the box but I have been able to bend and stoop better than I would have thought when I first put them on.  They are also surprisingly lightweight for warm winter boots.  They are true to my size 9 womens foot.  The only negative I can come up with is that the shaft is big and the laces don't help in tightening them up.  I do have small legs though and I do not tuck my pants into them either.  If you have bigger calves or want to tuck in your jeans or snowpants you'll be fine.  My jeans fit over the top just fine.  I would wear a long sock to keep them from rubbing my legs
580,"i could not wait to get these boots in the mail...the boot itself is great--looks just like the photograph, if not better--and it's very very well-made.  but since i am on the thin-side, the top of the boot did not fit the way i had imagined, and i tend to wear longer-styled pants and gauchos with these.  the space in the back of the boot is quite noticeable on me, but again, the boot itself is great--just a tip more than anything"
581,Great stuff.  I brought a couple of pair to try and they'd have to be the best jocks I own.  The double front mesh panels seem to be able to adjust to just the right size.  These provide a comfortable amount of support and yet allow for reasonable bit movement.  Highly recommended
582,"Beautiful Shoes, my favorite pair!  You can't find these everywhere, so take advantage of getting them delivered to your door.  They were a bit sore around the heels when I first wore them, but I guess I broke them in.  You'll forget all about that when you look at them.  They definitely make whatever I'm wearing look even better.  Go ahead and treat yourself"
583,"Best cut t-shirt for me. I like it many times more than American Apparel, Hanes & FOTL"
584,"I've ordered a few different pairs of socks off of Amazon (Gold Toe socks, Tommy Hilfinger socks), but so far these Adidas socks have been the highest quality.  They're nice and thick, and fit well to your foot -- they won't slide around and bunch up.  They've held up well for the first few washings, and have stayed quite bright.  I like 'em"
585,The quality of the material was better than I expected.  The color was a visually pleasing tone different than anticipated. I appreciate the cut of the design.
586,For the price of this suit I was expecting something of okay quality and was plesently suprised when I recieved it. The fabric feels good and seems to be a good quality. This suit would be perfect for ANY occasion my son may need a black suit.  If you need a specific color tie though you may want to order it seprately. It came with a black tie even though the picture I ordered from showed a red tie and the product descripiton doesn't specify color.  If your wondering how fast they ship out-I ordered it priority on Sunday and recieved it thursday
587,"I've been married long enough now that socks are an acceptable gift for my husband.  He was not having success finding over the calf athletic socks in local sporting good stores.  I was happy to find these on Amazon as Gold Toe is a quality product, made of durable elastic. These stay up, don't stretch, and don't get nubby like nasty, cheap cotton.  My only rule is--dear husband must wear them under pants and not with shorts.  For shorts, the Gold Toe ankle socks are a must"
588,"O zapatillas, no se. Me compré las negras y estoy muy contento. Las uso para casi toda ocasión"
589,"My nephew had requested a Babe Ruth t-shirt for Christmas.  I am notorius for buying LATE and there were only 4 business days left. To my surprise, during the busiest time of the year, the shirt was wrapped and under the tree.  My nephew was so excited when he opened his gift!!!  The shirt was exactly what he wanted and the quality was excellent!!  The shirt was from Fans Edge and they did an EXCELLENT job shipping the item out F-A-S-T"
590,"excellent....these socks were very comfortable and as my daughter was playing soccer in the fall when it started getting cold, these socks kept her feet warm and toasty."
591,Items were just as ordered.  They are well made and hold up very well.  Shipment was received quickly
592,"They aren't warm enough to be worn outside when it's cold, but are perfect for warming my hands when I'm at the computer"
593,"Overall very comfortable but were a little stiff at first, got some blisters but now they feel as good as sneakers with very good support."
594,"I bought a couple of these bodysuits because I thought that they were quite amusing. The quality seems ok - I have not washed them yet so I can't comment on the color fastness - the dark blue seems a like it may fade.The first thing I noticed was that the bodysuits are very long. They are not the stardard length you get with Gerber and Carter's etc. The 0-3 mths has the length of a normal 6-9mth bodysuit. The chest area is ok but the armholes are a bit small. In the bigger sizes the armholes seem normal. I have to wait until my son gets here to decide if I will convert the smaller ones into tees. 
This would have gotten 5 stars if the sizing was right - Hope this helps future buyers!!!"
595,"My black leggings are immensely comfortable and fit great.  I plan on purchasing a few more pairs; however, in different colors.  I have received catalogues from Silhouettes and am very impressed with all the great clothing."
596,"I ordered these dance shoes for my toddler, who loves to dance but has not started lessons yet.  They are a soft, sturdy, well-constructed shoe at a price that is easy to digest.  Having ""real dance shoes"" has helped to continue that spark of interest in her.  She wears them daily, and they are holding up well.  They also stay on, even with all the twists and turns on both hard floor and carpet.  I would buy these shoes again and recommend them to anyone with the same needs in a shoe"
597,I have 4 pair and will buy more. I love the fit and they are so comfortable to wear.
598,The microfiber was not only great feeling but was a very beautiful color. The terry lining was the perfect feel without being too thick. The weight was heavy enough to cause it to drape nicely. It went down to her ankles which is where she wanted it but that would have been easy since she is 5'2. We were very happy with it thank you
599,"These shorts are great for working in a warm climate.  I have several pairs of these I like them.  The cell phone pocket needs a flap because the phone can slip out when you sit down.  The people at ""Andrew Christian"" who actually provided the shorts were really first class to work with.  Exceptional"
600,"I was looking for a lightweight windbreaker, but with more substance than the typical nylon jacket, and this is it.  The shell is polyester/cotton with a Teflon coating and has that 'London Fog' feel and look to it, very elegant.  And it has a very nice cotton plaid lining inside that gives the jacket the feel of wearing a coat and not that thin nylon windbreaker feel.  Yet, it seems as light as a nylon windbreaker.  Should it rain, the water rolls right off due to the Teflon coating.  Under the front flaps up to the neck is a netting that allows the coat to breathe and keep things comfortable inside.  The neck area and the zipper flap keep out the wind and rain when it's too warm outside for a heavy coat.  And it's machine washable and dryer safe.  I like how it looks on me and the way it feels wearing it.  Here in the San Francisco Bay Area where it can be chilly in the morning, and anything from cool to warm or foggy and windy in the afternon, with this coat I'm ready for anything!"
601,"I have tried the Columbia Slider, the Reebok Slider, Sketchers Slider, Nike slider, and always come back to the Columbia.  I shop for them on sale, year round.  We live in a city where it's warm ten months out of the year, so we live in our sandals.  I have a pair of these on my feet now, and two new pairs still in the boxes, in my closet.  I love these sandals.  Pros....mold to your feet, slip ons, can be dressy or casual.  Cons....even though they are advertised as having anti smell soles, they stink.  After wearing them for about a month, the soles smell awful.  My family call these sandals, ""your stinky sandals"".  They complain when I take them off because they reeeek of sweaty,smelly feet.  Remedy:  Refresh RX foot power...this stuff will get rid of any smelly foot odor in any shoe.  I hope Columbia never stops making this slider, I just wish they didn't smell of sweaty feet so fast."
602,"Being a plus size woman, I have a terrible time finding knee socks that will fit my legs.   I wear knee socks all winter for warmth here in Western NY. I discovered that ""over-the-knee"" socks have a wider top (because smaller women wear them up to their thighs) and they stay up.  These socks were so nice when I received the two I ordered I quickly ordered two more pair.  I only wear them up to my knee, but they fit wonderfully and keep me warm all day.

I bought a pair for my niece who is a tiny thing and she wears them over her knee and they fit her perfect too because while the tops are stretchable, they snap right back so thin people can wear them also.

The price is good too and I received them just days after ordering.  Great product and a great company"
603,This is a very nice looking top!  Fits well!  I love it
604,"I was looking for the lightest, slimmest possible wallet, and the Dopp Getaway is just about perfect.  For the first couple of weeks I kept sticking my hand in my pocket to make sure it was still there - it's that unobtrusive.  It's made out of soft, thin leather (so thin, actually, that the embossed lettering on my credit cards shows through the surface).  That might affect the durability, but it certainly keeps the overall bulk of the wallet down.  The illustration shows a large embossed crest, but mine arrived with only discreet lettering saying ""Dopp"" at the bottom - a significant improvement, in my mind.  The wallet has pockets for 3 credit cards and a little pouch, open on the top and one side, to hold your cash.    There's also one additional pocket that's ideal for other documents you just have to carry.  The only slight negative for me was the caramel-colored vinyl lining of the cash pocket.  I don't know why they used such a low-class material there.  It's invisible from the outside, and not really offensive, but if I could change one thing, that would be it.  I debated knocking off a star for it, but the overall function and appearance of the wallet is so excellent that I thought it deserved the full five stars.

Overall, if you're disciplined about what you carry, you'll love the small size and low bulk of this wallet."
605,The product is in good condition when it was shipped. The quality is good. Thank you.
606,I tore my plantar facia a couple of years a go and have worn Clarks ever since. I like these shoes because they are comfortable but still look good.
607,Bought them for a costume party. Very high! wear at your own risk
608,"Awesome looking and very comfortable, be sure to get a size smaller than you normally would wear.  I wear a 13, but ordered a 12 based on other reviewers, and they fit perfectly.  I wear these with jeans on casual Friday's at work all the time"
609,These slippers are warm and comfy. The only complaint I had is on one side the little plastic tag didn't go all the way through the slipper - it was stuck somewhere inside and I had to resort to pliers to pull it out through the bottom so I wasn't walking on it all the time
610,"Hopefully it's okay I use Amazon's kid review since I wish to remain anonymous.

I've been wearing male underwear all my life, but this is really comfortable. Of course I could probably find the male equivalent of this panty, but hey, if it works, go with it"
611,I really love the quality. My daughter now has about two sets of them. she looks so adorable in them. My friends and family also like them and are going to get them for there kids as well
612,"This little bag is adorable AND affordable - take it from someone who is sick of seeing Coach around every corner.  

It is lined with a beautiful pastel blue satin.  The bag is pretty durable and I have gotten SO many compliments on it.

It is not for the gal who likes to carry everything in her bag, but has room for a phone, small wallet and a few other essentials.  

Love it"
613,"These pants make your legs look skinner!!  Yippie!  The tall was a little too long for my 5'7 1/2"" frame"
614,"I'm a pretty sexy girl and these so called panties are just about too sexy for me. Ooooweee do I feel hot when I have 'em on. Levi's, shorts, dress or trucker's overhauls, it makes no difference. The whole rest of the world might not know what you have on under there, but you'll know and that's enough to add a certain blush to your face, let me tell you. They made me feel ready for bed all day long"
615,"This is my second pair of Tsubo boots and I love them.
I completely loved my first pair , but unfortunately left them in a hotel room in Atlanta.  I was devastated when I realized what I did.

I recommend these boots to all"
616,These socks really make a difference in confort during outdoor activities. I even wear them around the house because they are way more confortable then my everyday cotton crew socks
618,"Sizing seems to be about right, although they are a little narrow at the ball of the foot.  I've had them for a couple of weeks and they're breaking in nicely and have stretched where they were a little tight at first.  Being lined with leather helps this.  They seem to be good quality and are very beautiful.  Also note, they are a little looser around the calf than some, still wearable with a short skirt, but also workable for putting jeans inside them, perfect really.  I love them!"
619,"Well, I live in Texas...i can't ski very often...however, I slipped on this pair of socks and got a running start at a freshly waxed wood floor and relived the '69 winter olymipcs! It was great...oh, and they're really soft and fuzzy and feel really good on my feet, too"
620,"First thing, you have to buy half a size bigger. I'm a 6.5 and got a 7 and it feels about right. Second, they hurt at the beginning. You have to get used to wearing them. But, they are totally cute, good materials, and unbeatable price"
621,I bought these slippers for my office so I can kick off my shoes when my feet are tired and slip these on. They are classy and so comfortable. I don't think anybody notices I'm wearing slippers. I plan to buy another pair for home
622,"This case protects better than anything out there, and the color is awsome!  My Gear Store also got the case to me super fast"
623,man made doc martins need major breaking in. order a size to small if you have thin feet the steel toes run big
624,"These shoes really do wear like iron, and are superbly comfortable--once they are broken in. The sizing takes some getting used to. I recommend buying (or at least trying on) Dr. Martens in a store the first time, to find out one's size in the British system. My USA size is 10D. Yet, the Dr. Martens that works for me is UK 10/USA 11. Go figure. When the first pair of these I got began to look shabby, I simply polished it with brown shoe polish. That pair of shoes is still fine, after being worn more days than any shoes I have ever had"
625,"My husband will only wear these certain type of socks, that are called over the calf gold toe socks. We used to buy them at Penneys but now we couldn't find them. I was looking for them thru google and Amazon poped up. I always have good luck with Amazon so I ordered 3 sets. Amazon saved the day!"
626,Item is very well made and true to size.  Price was great as comparing other similar jackets.
627,"The protective skin is perfect.  It fit over the device without any problem, and it has already provided good protection to the screen and body of my zen.  As a comparison, my cell phone which I've carried in my pocket for the last two years looks like it's been run over by a car - I think with this skin the zen will hold up better.  The screen protector is a nice touch.

The armband is not something I use with a device this hefty.  The belt clip is suspect- it's too flimsy for me to use and feel confident with. But the skin allows me to put the zen right in my pocket without digging out a protective bag or other cover.  The skin alone is worth the cost"
628,"I travel a lot! I would recommend this for everyone. It is extremely compact and convenient. And it helps to ""know"" ahead of time what your luggage weighs as to avoid switching and swapping items from bag to bag and/or paying extra fees for overweight luggage- not to mention holding up the line. :-"
629,i am 14 but i have a large penis i was wondering if these would stretch much i normaly wear breifs two sizes up and safety pin the band can you hel
630,"Even though the Bears did not win this years Superbowl, it's important to realize they finally made it to the final dance, after all those years of having average or below average seasons.  When it comes to a Superbowl win, it's basically a coin toss (no pun intended) on who will win.  We're talking about two great teams (in this case, Colts and Bears) and the Superbowl is basically just the two best teams battling it out.  NFC champs are the Chicago Bears.  That's the important thing to remember.

This t-shirt should proudly be worn, even if you don't live near or in Chicago.  The Bears were a great team in 2006.  With this shirt, you will always remember the amazing year they had"
632,everything was perfect it was exactly what i expected. came in a timely fashion. would order from here again
633,"I have worn nothing but levi's for over 20 years now, and I have been through almost every style of them.  These are still the same great jeans, reliable fit and quality that you know.  Currently I have three of these in my closet nest to standard 505's, and they are virtually identical, but the signiture series cost a lot less. Same thick denim material, unlike a lot of fancy boutique jeans, that last a long time, and can stand up to most activities that an active person does.  Check these out, you won't be dissapointed, and neither will your wallet"
634,"A little bulkier than I expected given that it has six card slots. Still, I'm happy with it. Seems better constructed than the Dockers front-pocket wallet it replaced"
635,"I love my Crocs Cayman Clogs!  They are extremely soft and comfortable and yet durable enough to be worn anywhere.  Between my Birks and Crocs, I am set for every spring & summer!  Just know to purchase one size down for comfort.  I wear size 12 but found that the Crocs size ""Large 10-11"" fit me well.  The size ""Extra Large 12-13"" were much too big.  I was not disappointed with the purchase.  A five star rating for comfort!"
636,"I own this shoe in a size 8 and love it. It is moderately comfortable for a high heel, and really pretty in real life. It makes one's foot/leg look very feminine. It is a tall heel and I think that is probably why. Worth the money."
637,"It is hard to find pants for my son, but Dickies have pants that fit, wear well, and cost a fair price"
638,"I really like the look of these panties all lacy and feminine. They feel good on, look great and best of all, they're low cut so you can were them with your jeans riding low on your hips. And if a bit of panty does peek out all the better, cuz these are so cute. Pretty darned enticing too, if you know what I mean"
639,"Got these to replace some Sketchers and for the price it was a pretty good deal. They are lightweight and make you forget that you are wearing shoes.

I removed 1* cause the color is not one of my favorite.."
640,I purchased these for my Mother as a Christmas present.  They are so soft to the touch and I was able to get them in a 7.5 wide which is unusual.  The color is nice too
643,"excellent product, hard to find in stores, quick delivery...great price..
today comfort...tomarrow diet"
644,"This bag gets the job done, looks nice and is durable.  My only complaint it that the straps could be longer so it could go over my shoulder"
645,Used all summer long almost everytime i was outdoors. Has held up well so far and has a really cute design. it was shipped very fast. Thanks
646,"I remember the Wonder Woman TV series. Linda Carter just looked so hot in that outfit. Well, maybe this cami and panty set won't cling to your body the way Linda's did and maybe the ordinary girl isn't as busty as Ms. Carter, but let me tell you, you'll feel pretty wonderful as you climb into bed dressed up as that woman with the golden lasso. And you'll look good too. I don't know, I really thought my guy Jack would like these undies, but son of a gun, after just one look at me in these and he couldn't wait to get 'em off me. Oooo Weee"
647,"I agree with the previous review -- but I am not small. I am a medium to large sized person who wants a natural look in a bra, support without too much construction, light weight, and invisible under both work and casual clothing. I found everything I wanted in this item. Straps don't fall because of the cross back, material is comfortable and cool. I will buy more"
648,"These shoes are very sexy, very chic fit.  I love them!! It's a good buy"
649,"my husband was very happy with this jacket, adn the price was great"
650,"I get compliments on these shoes all the time, which is a bonus since I bought them to be comfortable. I walk allover UMASS-Amherst campus in these and feel that my feet and back are well-supported. In fact, these shoes look even better when they're a little scuffed up. Definetely worth the money"
651,"My daughter says: ""They are so beautiful! I have the red pair and the golden pair. I like them so much, I want to kiss them!""
 I say: ""They are really spectacular-looking"""
652,I been looking for a beat for a while that fits good and this belt fits very good---thank
653,Robe is really light and has a sleek silky feel. Great for wearing around the house on a hot summer night. Great buy for the price
654,This bundle includes everything you need to use your Zen Vision M since it comes with nothing. I use the portable charger all the time since I have a laptop which is only on when I am using it. Without the portable charger my player would be dead all the time! I recommend this bundle
655,"I love these little jeans. They look fantastic on my daughter. I love that they are plain, without any embellishments. She's a skinny little thing and these jeans actually fit and stay up on her. I probably wash then twice a week, but they are holding up really well! These are the best kids jeans I've ever seen."
656,I am very happy with this bag.  It is exactly what I thought it would be.  Thank yo
657,"My 4 year old new he wanted to be a policeman since August, so we went looking in September and ended up buying this one.  It is great! The quality is amazing.  The details are great.  Compared to a friend of his with one of those store bought costumes, there was no comparison.  The only issue was the hat which we fashioned a strap to keep it on.  My son has worn it at least 10 times with a full day of pre-school included and it is still in great shape"
658,"I was very pleased with my order of the jersey.  The quality was excellent, and it was delivered in a prompt manner and packaged nicely.  My son loves it, wore it to school the day after the Super Bowl, and it was a real hit"
659,"I recently was hired as a school crossing guard and found that it was time to order some warm socks.  These are a very good buy.  They are big ( I thought I was ordering a woman's size). As it turned out, the larger size is fine and I can put them in my dryer and not worry that they will shrink. They feel great and are very warm"
660,"these tags are so cute......plus they are extra large and combined with the bright colors, your luggage will really stand out!!  I have black luggage and these tags work really well for me, plus the price is hard to beat for getting an oversized tag, with so many great colors to choose from.  I also recommend giving as a gift, something people might need but wouldn't necessarily think to ask for, and you will not find these in a store"
662,"The shoes just arrived.  They have one adjustable strap and the sole bed is comfy and supports the arch of my foot.  Great Shoes, girls.  Get a pair in more than one color - you will be wearing them all the time.  Put some leather water repellant on the shoes before you wear them.  Clark's Shoes Rock!!"
664,These shoes are comfort and light weight. I have arch pain. And these shoes reduce some of my arch pain
665,I'm very pleased with the slippers and my experience with Amazon and Land's End was excellent
666,"With the price, this is a great pair of low ankle boots.  I was thrilled by the quality and style when I received the product.  I bought a pair of Kenneth Cole boots (same style) with the price of $100 but the material was so cheapy"
667,Perfect Size for me.  I love the length of the strap.  Very well made.  The only reason I rated it a 4 is because I was looking for a red bag and this design doesn't have it.  I am experimenting this new brown and I am growing to like it more and more
668,The material and fit is perfect.  I try to stay away from underwires due to discomfort but this one is great
669,I bought the Jockey heavyweight muscle t-shirts for my grandson.  He told me that the fit was true to size and the material was of excellent quality
670,"This is a very high quality product...well-made, looks great in town and performs well on the trail"
671,Excellent product. using showers after work out. Sandals are dry quickly and are sturdy and comfortable
672,"I find that if I fasten the straps with a little leeway (i.e. flex my foot while fastening), then they're much less likely to come loose.  VERY comfortable shoes, and cuter than a lot of tennis shoes.  They do have more shine than you can really see in the online photos - I got the bronze - but I think it's cute"
673,I am glad i read the reviews before purchasing . i wear a size 10.5 so i ordered a 8.5 . They fit perfect . After wearing them around the house for a week to break them in they  feel great . Great value
674,The shoes are a great fit.  They arrived in time for Christmas.  I am very pleased with them
676,"These pants are very stretchy and comfortable.  They are a bit more form-fitting in the butt and thighs than I like, but wearable because they're so darn comfy"
677,"This accessory is great! Traveling is such a hassle, but this device took almost all of the hassle out of traveling. Whatever I needed it was there and in mosst cases, they checked my creditials with the documents IN the holder.Simply put your driver's license in the bottom window and boarding pass in top window with info displayed and you are set!

I highly recommend this for anyone who travels"
678,Kept my feet nice and warm in the snow and had good traction on ice.  Great price
680,This is the second Adidas warm up outfit I have and I like it very much.  The bright pink is a nice change from my other black one.
681,This is a cute restaurant style apron made of quality fabric.  The apron was just as pictured and the company shipped it promptly.
682,"I bought this.  The colors are great, the fit is great.  I highly recommend it"
683,The item was just what I ordered and the service and delivery were excellent
684,"I give 5 stars for the easy spirit sandle I ordered , I like it. Delivery is fast. I will order something else"
685,"My son looked so adorable in this costume. Everyone who saw him loved it, they never seen a costume like this before."
686,"Don't know where else to find a garter panty set (arrived fast too) for this price. They say economy, so wasn't expecting much, but we're still enjoying this set to spice up special evenings! We bought the One Size (for a size 8) and it is perfect and adjusts"
687,I have been wearing New Balance Women's 574 Suede/Leather sneaker for the last three years. I love them for the variety of colors and for the fact that I don't look like every other person walking down the street. I love and value my individuality as well as my feet. These shoes definitely combine comfort and fashion
688,"These are the best slippers I have ever owned!!!  They cradle your feet in super soft memory foam.  When I get home from work everyday, I slide my feet into them and am instantly relaxed.  I love these slippers!!!  The best ever... after much wear, I will buy another pair"
690,This is a very nice umbrella. It is big enough to cover you without your legs getting drenched but also doesn't feel cumbersome
691,"Skinny Rails are perfect for those of us who like tight jeans from top to bottom. Very narrow at the bottom, but fine over sneakers. If you're not self conscious about your skinny legs, these are the jeans for you. Spandex gives them the stretch that make them very comfortable even though they're tight. They did not shrink during first wash. Great dark color. Perfect for the anti-baggy guy"
693,"I love these slippers...my favorites so far.  I chose these for the soles, so I could run outside if I needed to (mailbox, trash).  I toss them in the washing machine and the dryer.

Two complaints:  They make my feet a bit sweaty and hold on to smells, so my feet get smelly....so I throw them in the washing machine more often than I probably should.  Also, the back of the heel is smushed from my wearing them, and I can't get it to stay 'un-smushed'"
694,"My review from another shipper:  The Lilyette 458 is the best bra EVER!! I was a slave to Bali because a.) didn't really know what cup size I needed; but more importantly, b.) most stores don't carry anything larger than the DD cup size that didn't fit so I could see what DID fit. The Lilyette #428 has that rocket shaping and it looks ridiculous. This cup design gives a smooth, curvy, high-riding, NATURAL look. No points, cones, or rockets. I love it"
695,"I really like this bag.  The colors are bright, it is super light weight, and I really like that it has a snap and a pocket.  You don't see many tote bags that have either of those.  It's also very reasonably priced, if not down right inexpensive for what you get.  My only beef is that the shipping cost seemed a bit pricey.  Maybe it was because I got 3 at once."
696,"Well, until I read the review below, I'd have never have noticed but yes, there is an ""odor"" to the bag. Although in all honesty, my wife and I aren't really big bag sniffers so we never got wind of this. We aren't much in the habit of sniffing bags, shoes, etc. Perhaps we are missing out. I don't know. So, maybe for kids who are just sniffing bags and licking this and that, this isn't the right bag. But for the wife, it was perfect. It's a great price, very nice looking and they got it shipped out to us lickety split. I think if you spend $25 or more, shipping is even free (we love the free shipping). I've not been a big shopper of those in the Amazon shops. This was a great experience, however, so we'll surely give it a go again"
697,"I use this all of the time.  It gives good protection, ease of use, and good handling.  Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock.  However, this is true of any protective skin.  Outstanding product."
698,"I am a regular fitness swimmer and go through the lycra suits every 4-6 months.  They always get too stretched out and cause drag in the water.  This suit is holding up beautifully with none of the usual snags and wear marks from getting in and out of the pool.  Also, I'm usually a size 16, on the chunky side, but this suit looks good on me and fits well even in a size 14.  Really glad I found it"
701,my son loves these wears them all the time! looks so cute in the
703,"These panties fit and feel great. They never ride up in the rear, and they don't show above today's lower rise pants. I completely wore out my last 3-pack so I'm very glad to see these are still in production"
704,THis is a great additional purchase to the Princess costumes.  Just know for little fingers (children) they are hard to put on - requires parental assistance
705,"These were exactly what I wanted for my new daughter-in law.  The insole is cushy, the outer sole gives traction. The red is beautiful for Christmas. The velour looks elegant. They are easy to get into and slip off."
707,"These bibs are great!  The fabric is very light weight - not stiff and heavy like the plastic coated bibs sold at BRU.  They are still water proof - milk, juice and water just run down the front and collect in the pocket.  Even though lots has gone down the bib, my baby's clothes are still dry.  The velcro is extra long instead of a stingy little square so it can be adjusted to fit small babies (mine is 6 months) or big ones.  They wash up quickly in the sink, rinsing out easily or can be thrown in the washer.  They air dry quickly... wash after breakfast, dry by lunch!  I love them and won't buy any others ever again"
708,"a great bag, nice leather, beautiful shade of brown.  I love the size and design, as it was what I was looking for. Arrived fast.  There's a few scratches on it already from using it.  I'm not the most gentle on things, but not rough.  the buckles on it are not solid metal, they're like hollowed out.  That would be my only complaint or disappointment.  Great for the price, perfect size to supplement your purse to work"
709,I prefer front closure bras without a lot of padding & this is a style I lik
710,"The t-shirt is just as advertised.  I like the yellow color a lot, but like any t-shirt the design will fade more easily if you tumble dry it rather than hang it up"
711,"These shorts are comfortable - all cotton.  Great for working out.  I wish they had a lining, though"
712,I ordered this jersey as a gift for Christmas without any problems. It was delievered as stated
713,"Bought this for my 5th grade daughter.  She loves the bag, and it is fairly stable, as it doesn't seem to tip over (sideways) easily.  Only complaint is that Snaredrum Grey color is much lighter than we had anticipated, and after a couple of months of daily use, it is getting pretty dirty"
715,"This is a very decent accessory package; the chargers work very well and are incredibly convenient compared to the bulky Toshiba charger. The belt clip feels a little flimsy but it has held tight. The silicone skin works; it doesn't fit perfectly and it doesn't cover the screen, of course, but it keeps the body from getting scratched. The removable stand is great for video viewing"
717,"These shoes are great looking--very sexy.  They are snug in the toe, especially if you have a wider foot"
719,"i bought a pair of these shoes in red because they just looked so hot, i live in Australia so it took a while for them to arrive, i was a bit nervous with the sizing, as being Australian our sizing is different to America's i bought a size 9 because i'm about at 8 1/2 in Aus sizes. But they fit perfectly and are suprisingly comfortable, i could wear them all day and my feet won't be sore, its fantastic and they are so hot! i want to get other colours now."
720,"my husband is very pleased with this jacket,lightweiht,high quality,
for every occasion.we have even ordered another jacket for our son.
S.Faleev"
721,They look nice and are decently comfortable.  They work for me. I would buy them again
722,great looking shoes. I bought the gray/shade ones and they look just like in the picture.
724,"Very nice sandal, lookes great with a dress or jeans. Low enough to wear for hours at a time, but high enough heel to make it look chic"
725,"These arrived on the same day as my Nike Airmax shoes - never thought a thing about the socks - thought the Nikes were the most comfortable shoes I have ever had. Then I wore the socks with some uncomfortable boating sandals - they too felt the most comfortable ever! This has happened with all my shoes.

It is astonishing, to me, that socks can have such a wonderful effect. A luxurious feel. I can recomend them"
726,It is definitely worth buying.  great shipping speed and the quality is excellent
728,Delivery was quick and all packages arrived in good shape. We have not yet used the merchandise to rate the product. It appears to be of sufficient quality
729,I bought the short crew version b/c I had to reach my $25 max for the free shipping.  I fell in love with the socks and bought more including this one which is just as soft and comfy with that cushioned feeling
731,"There are several features I like about this product.  Most importantly, the bra supports and yet has smooth lines under silky clothes and the front dips below the waist so you don't have that sausage roll effect where the abdomen bulges when the bra stops.  Another plus is that it comes with clear straps you can use for extra support.  I only have 2 negatives.  First, I believe the ad said it came with both clear AND straps to match the bra but when it arrived only clear was included.  (I didn't pursue this.)  However, the biggest negative is that the cups are not just lined but padded.  I personally find that makes the bra less useful and can even disturb the lines of some clothing.  Sometimes less IS more"
732,These shoes are awsome! My son absolutely loves them! He says that they have got to be the most comfortable shoes he has ever owned...well worth the price
733,"Item arrived in new condition, packaged nicely, invoice enclosed and on time! No complaints"
735,I bought the glasses as a gift and the individual is enjoying them.
737,"This is absolutely one of the most comfortable heels I have in my closet.
great buy good pric"
738,"Very happy with this product. They are substantial so they are ""suitable"" for a Medium or Large and not someone who is Small.
 
 Delivery was fast and it was well packed. Shipping was included, though I didn't realize it until the end of the ordering process."
739,"These fit a tiny bit loose but the comfort level is great.  Shoes at Amazon.com are one of my favorite on-line purchases, great prices"
743,I was very pleases with my purchase of the looipop legband briefs. They are very comfortable
744,I found it very comfortable with good fitting. I bought 4 pairs in last 3 and half years and this one was the best. I gave it 5 stars based on comparing with other brands that I bought. Overall quality is good.
746,"As I approach 50, I find myself in retro mode.  I sought out the adidas I loved in grade school and found them.  Having purchased the blue (Rom's) I found them to look every bit like the orignals.  I got many flattering comments.  However, you get what you pay for; these are not the most high quality shoe.  They are one size too tight.  If you buy one size larger you'll be fine, but wear them sparingly for looks, not performance.  I'm going to buy a second pair, but this time a size larger"
747,"This was my very first pair of Tsubo shoes. I have since purchased many more. I fell in love with these first site and first try on. They simply feel fabulous on my feet, and get many compliments from others. These shoes are the bomb"
748,This was a gift for our daughter in NYC who was visiting us during the holidays.  She wore it every day!  And said many times that it was the best gift she'd received
749,"These shorts are pretty cute, however they do run a little small. I bought them twice because the first pair was much to tight on my son, but I liked them so I wanted him to have them"
750,"Compre dos pares de estos zapatos (marron y negro)como regalo para mi padre en navidad, y puedo decirle que quedo encantados con la comodidad y calidad de los materiales. Por eso los recomiendo con 5 estrellas"
751,"Very good for the cold, and rainy days or snow"
752,This swimsuit can double as a summer outfit. The colors are perfect and then there is Eeyore. Nice for girls that wear larger sizes
753,"My husband was very happy with this item.  The shirt is very high quality, and will withstand many washings"
754,"This would be a 5 star if it wasn't so bulky to carry - but I don't see how it could.  Otherwise, we love it"
755,"I started running again after many years.  I bought average shoes due to not knowing if I would stick with it.  After a few weeks of my feet hurting and feeling like they were numb I went and got fitted for shoes.  These shoes had the ""ah"" factor right away.  I didn't truly believe the ""shoe factor"" that states the shoes are everything.  Boy was I wrong!!!  They made an unbelievable difference and now 9 months later I am still running and have even entered several races.  I wouldn't do it without these shoes.  My running partner agrees.  Her knees are not in good shape, but she is now doing great with these shoes.  We're believers"
756,I've actually had The Strapper for a few months now and have been using it more and more .  You don't even know your wearing the thing.  Can't praise it enough and the price is right too!
757,"I have short hair, not ultra-short, but short, and I find that a few hot curlers can make a big difference in volume on ""bad hair days."" While I have a full-sized Conair curler set, I discovered that my travel set was really best suited to my hair length. So travel or not, this little set has become a real favorite. 

What you get 
The Remington Travel Hair curlers come in a nylon bag with the heating unit build in. The top is clear and fastened by velcro. You pull it open and plug it in to start heating the rollers. On the side of the nylon bag is a smaller, oblong bag holding the roller clips. 

There are five medium rollers (about an inch in diameter) and five small rollers, about 5/8 inch diameter.) There are two sets of clips, pink for the large roller, white for the smaller roller. The clip fits around the roller, and has a tab to aid grabbing it for removal. 

The rollers turn from pink to greyish white when they are heated. They fit into the base over a socket with two prongs. They heat up in about 2 minutes. 

How they work 

The rollers claim to have ""Ionic Technology"" to reduce static and the frizzies. I find that my hair is indeed smooth when I take it out of the rollers. After I let the curls cool, I can style with no frizz. 

The ends of the rollers stay cool to avoid burning your head. They are a bit heavy. 

I leave the rollers in for five to fifteen minutes, by which time my hair is well-curled. 

Upsides, downsides 
To keep this set compact, there are only 10 rollers. I could use a few more, even with my short hair. The built-in travel bag is very well designed and compact for a suitcase or small bathroom. 

If you LOSE THE CLIPS, you can find a general replacement style of clip for about $10 at http://www.ballbeauty.com/remington_hair_setters.htm#CLIPS. I dropped two of my white clips and the cats apparently made off with them as trophies of their hunting prowess. So this is helpful to know where to buy more clips. 

The curls last long, though they aren't as stiff as with some of the more expensive, foam covered type of curlers"
760,"I'm not a fan of pointy toe shoes, but I decided to go with the flow and buy these. I was pleasantly surprised - these boots are very comfortable and true to size. Leather on the outside is very soft, but the best part is that these boots are also lined with extremely soft leather. The heel is 2.5 inches on the inside, and 3.5 inches on the outside. Despite being higher than what I'm used to - these boots are still surprisingly stable"
761,This is a very good quality and funtional mask. I use this under a full face helmet for cold weather Motorcycle riding. priced right. Velcro adjustable.  Long enough to cover neck area
762,"I love this case.  I used to have one of the new iSkins but since the ipod wouldn't fit in my car charger/FM tuner with the skin on, it took forever to peel it off everytime I wanted to use it in my car.  This works much better for me.  It's easy to quickly access and remove the ipod from the case for car use, but the rest of the time it's a great case to bring on trips.  The new ipod fits snugly in the case and the openings for the USB port and headphone jack align perfectly.  The magnetic closure is nice so you don't have to hear the sound of velcro ripping every time you want to open it.

My only complaint is that dust gets stuck between the plastic cover and the screen, but from what I've read that happens with every single case on the market except for the iSkin.  If you are going to be taking the ipod out of the case on a regular basis, this is a great alternative to the iSkin"
763,"I am large chested (38 C/D) and have been running my whole life.  I finally found the best running bra!  The band is adjustable to 3 different lengths.  I bought a 36 C to really keep ""locked and loaded"".  The shoulder straps are adjustable from the front.  You don't have to take off the bra to tighten it up.  The velcro straps stay secure so you don't end up with chaffing.  Love, love, love this bra!!!!!"
766,"I got exactly what I ordered, in good condition and pretty fast considering it was December!  Thanks for a great way to shop"
767,They are exactly what I was hoping they would be.  I love the contoured front pouch.  All the web sites I saw and read about them said you may want to order 1 size larger then normal.  I would agree with this unless you want a more snug fit.  My wife loves them as well and was quite pleased with the look and feel.  I ordered 4 different pairs of Unico's and they're all good quality and look and feel great
768,"I love Gold Toe brand socks.  Their are the only brands I buy, especially the Canterbury model.  I highly recommend Gold Toes!"
770,"When I ordered the item I wasn't given any expected date of arrival or any option on shipping speed.  I had 10 days to get the item before the event - and it arrived well after date needed.  I realize this is an outside vendor, but usually Amazon items come quite quickly.
Thanks,
Debbi"
772,I remember the old Dr. Scholls wood sandals when I think of this brand. These boots are very nice and well styled. What an improvement
773,The rack is great and my husband loved it. The product is of high quality . Since I misunderstood the size of the rack--I called customer service and was amazed at the professionalism and help I received when I was a little upset. Great experience all around
774,I'm very happy with this purchase.  Great for hiking and many extra pockets for carrying 'stuff' beyond water
775,"We bought two clothes line to Honduras.  This one and the ""Rick Steeves"" - this was by far better.  It was longer,  it had suction cups (which actually worked) and little plastic clips on both ends.  I lost one suction cup end but it was fine because I would loop the line around with the use of the clip.  It also was a loose weave so we could use it to hold the items (we didn't bring enough small clothes pins).  It worked great."
776,I bought these crocs for my daughter during the summer and she absolutely loves them and I now can't get her to put her winter boots on when it snows. The crocs are exceptionally comfortable and lightweight. I am very happy with my purchase and free shipping also
777,The cost was great with lots of detail. Our 8-year old grandson loved it and has worn it to play in besides for Halloween
778,"I have ordered this tux for my 18 months old son for my sister's wedding. It looked amazing!!!

The suit arrived timely and I couldn't believe how perfect they have prepared the whole package. All the details were well thought and the tux looked perfect with satin buttons, matching waist band and stripes on the side of the pants. Even the shirt is so well tailored. 

My son was very comfortable in the suit during the whole night and accepted more applouds than the groom!

I sincerely recommend this product"
779,"I did a great deal of research in choosing a case for my new iPod. I decided on the iSkin, and I have been quite satisfied with my decision. I do remember, however, being a bit confused as to just how this case worked. So, to clarify for future buyers, the case is comprised of:

-First, a thin, transparent silicone (rubber) sleeve. The sleeve covers most of the front and back, including a slightly thinner cover where the wheeel would be placed. This ensures that the wheel maintains its touch sensitivity while also being protected. The skin does not, however, cover the screen, and a portion of the back is also exposed to attach an optional belt clip. This sleeve can also come in various colors, but I used the clear one to highlight the natural color of my iPod. 

-Second, a hard, clear plastic front plate can be snapped on to the front of the iPod once it is placed in the silicone. This hard case does cover the screen, and all of the front of the iPod, except for a hole for the touch wheel. Once attached, the hard cover is firmly held in place. 

Put together, this case provides exceptional protection. The silicone is very thin, yet protects against ordinary dings and scratches. The hard plastic protects the front from impact, and the screen from scratches. The best part for me is that, even with both the silicone and the hard cover, the iPod Nano still retains its very thin size - the case is not bulky in the least. 

In conclusion, I highly recommend this case for anyone who purchases an iPod Nano. Protect your investment"
781,"I love this jacket!
Very cute and matches oodles of things in my closet.
Comfortable too"
782,"I put my new Rockport shoes on and they fit me perfectly, allowing me to wear them all day without the slightest discomfort.  I have never worn a more comfortable pair of dress shoes.  I walk all day, and usually my feet are dead when I come home.  With the Rockport shoes, I can do a 10-hour shift with no foot discomfort.

A very dressy shoe, I get a lot of compliments on the styling.  And when I flip them over and show people the soles, they want them!  I was originally put off by the price of the shoes, but after wearing them for a week, they are worth every penny.

I will buy this product (or a similar Rockport shoe) again"
783,"This was just what I was looking for and couldn't find in local
retail stores.  Fits perfectly in my wallet and now my credit
cards don't fall on the ground in stores!  Reasonable price also.
Excellent product"
784,Have always been pleased with this manufactures product. The company I purchased from was fair priced and very efficient
785,"Ordered seven shirts for groomsmen in a wedding wearing linen suits.  Really like how shirt has no front pockets, gives the shirt a classic look.  The shirts are of good quality, they wash and iron up nicely.  There are regular, tall, and large men sizes available.  Shipping was speedy.  Would gladly do business here again."
786,"The walking shoe is made for just that - walking.  There's less arch support than I had hoped for, but it's still an excellent shoe.  I do alot of treadmill walking in the winter, and it's very comfy and fits very well.  

When I need to run, I use my running shoes for that.  I try and keep my athletic shoes separate from the ""sneakers"" that I use to run around town in."
787,The size was perfect and so was the color.  It looked just like it did on the web page:)
789,Happy with this item. The support is good. material used in this product is nice and soft. Overall a comfortable feeling.
790,"This is a great shoe and I have no regrets about buying it.
Pros: Perfect balance of good looks and comfort
      High quality construction
      Non-slip sole
      
Cons: Sole is very squeaky on certain surfaces
      Clarks use the British sizes, so be careful when ordering your siz"
791,it was easy to order and very affordable and they were here quickly...I want to get more...thank
792,"The Kate is more padded around the heel than the original canvas sneaker.  It makes all the difference!  Instantly, your foot is snuggled by the shoe.  Comfortable!!!  I have 6 pairs.  Not a darn thing negative to say about this shoe.  You won't regret buying this shoe"
793,"These are stylish and nice and perfect to wear under a pair of cutoff Levi's. My cutoffs are so faded, so frayed, so, well you know. So when I peal them off to reveal this Butterfly Lace up Panty (in Black with the pick laces on the back) it's like an instant transformation from outdoor girl to bedroom girl. We only had two colors at our lingerie party, white and the black and pink models, but I can imagine all the colors would be nice too."
794,A good master piece having a lot of embroidery and at a reasonable pric
795,This bra offers the support I can't find in any other bra.  I love it!  I could even sleep in it comfortably.  It's great
796,"This is my 3rd pair of Frye boots, They look and fit well. They do need some time to break in. This brand has held up well in the past, and I expect the same of this pair"
797,"These thong sandals run true to size and are very lightweight.  They are also a shiny patent material.  These are the pluses.  The one minus that is just a thing with me is that they come up far on my foot.  That is, the toe piece seems a bit long.  I kept them because I know I will throw them on all summer to run around with my kiddos around the house.  I also do not think that they are really worth the price.  Yes, they are Tommy Hilfiger, but the name is all you are really paying for.  They are an okay shoe, overall - not my favorites"
799,"I couldn't be more pleased with my new swimsuits from Agonswim.  This suit is very well made and the color choices are truly extraordinary in men's fitted swimwear.  These are not just great for competition, but for the beach as well.  The materials, workmanship, cut, and stitching are first rate.  Remember to take a look at the sizing charts before ordering; generally speaking you will need to order the next size smaller than what you are probably used to from manufacturers like Speedo."
800,"Very happy with the product, especially for the price.  Fit great and are comfortable"
801,An I'm still wearing them.  I went through 4 laces and it's still going strong...  It is soo comfortable and a great work/casual shoe.  Highly recommended!!
802,"These boots are sturdy, comfortable and warm. Great purchase and quick delivery"
804,"Got an opportunity to use the rainsuit on fishing trip. Keeps you dry, but does not block the wind very well. Overall, good product for the price"
805,Great conversation starter. It always draws compliments from people I can connect with. It's the Dude fellowship
807,"I love my Vaneli Shoes. I have gotten so many compliments on them. Besides being very stylish, they are ""way"" comfortable!"
808,"These are really cute comfy shoes! Great price! You might want to buy two pairs because if you wear them alot,the front seems 2 rip a little.This is my second pair. Also the elastic on the back of the shoe is a little uncomfortable at first,but once they were worn in they are great. If you want black ones I suggest get the black lace because the leather will get messed up easily"
809,I received them as promised for Xmas. The old lady loved them. Thank
810,"i got this case as a present, and it is a really great case.  apart from the cool retro look of it, it protects my ipod and isn't at all bulky.  this case uses magnets for the flip top, which makes this case less bulky than other ipod cases.  my ipod fits very snugly in this case and theres a clear plastic that protects the screen.  the sides of the case stretch, so i'm pretty sure it would fit both the 30 and 60 gb ipod.  it is a bit pricey, but totally worth it.  buy this case"
811,"I was leery of trying a mule-type sneaker, wondering if it would would slap my heel with a ""thwak!"" every time I took a step.  Still, I'm the kind of person who'll go shoeless rather than tie laces.

The Travel Time Mule is very comfortable, and I tested my pair walking miles upon miles at a local attraction.  My feet sit securely in them and they're just so easy to take on and off.

My only complaint is that there is no ventilation to the shoe.  The top, which could easily provide a little air if differently constructed, is solid so that by day's end your feet will definitely be on the warm side.  However, the comfort and ease these shows provide make that only a moderate inconvenience"
813,"I would like to confirm the previous reviewer's comment that the color on this suit (Navy Blue) faded very quickly.  In addition I also found that the shape gets stretched and baggy fairly quickly, in spite of rinsing with fresh water after every chlorine exposure.  In general, this doesn't seem up to Speedo's usual quality, but for the price ($17) it's a good deal"
814,"These sunglasses are all right. They were a little crooked, but still cool.."
815,"This robe is well constructed of substantial cotton fabric.
It is nice and comfortable to wear. 
With moderate care (gentle wash, air dry) I'm sure it will last indefinitely."
817,"This Product is very good, the materials are tuff, and for 30 bucks that is really good. Laptop stays put in place and you have extra space for books and lots of other things"
818,"This bag is bigger then what you think it is. I was very pleased with the quality of this bag at the price you pay for it. I use it to carry books, lunch, and important things for work. I am very satisfied with this product"
819,"Everthing was fine.  I wish they could have hemmed them for me. 

We are Cool

Chuck"
820,The International Women's Genuine Shearling Slipper is well made and comfortable to wear.  It's rubber sole makes it a secure slipper on wet floors
821,"This with the PJ bottoms was a nice gift for my son. From all reports, they fit nicely and look good"
823,Received the shoes right on time as reported. The size is good according to my wife. She was happy to learn that they were Pu (non leather)
824,"I ordered this dress in black for my 15 year old daughter, and this dress definately is more gorgeous than you see on line.  One small problem is size, you can not order your correct size since this dress runs smaller.  My daughter is a size 16/18 and she needs a 3x.  The bust line has to be altered on the side and neck line.  I love this dress though.  I will be ordering this dress for my daughters Sweet 16 for 8 girls in Ice Blue.  I am just looking for a size chart.  You will love this dress also"
826,"I have had a black one of these for years, and the lace is just finally starting to go.  It's a great neckline for a more professional look (a little higher than the standard cami) - but the lace keeps it feminine with a little sexy.  The lace isn't sheer - and the lace straps are wide, easily concealing a bra straps for more open necks tops.  Also - the nylon exterior clings to NOTHING, and the inside cotton is super soft, and the lace is very soft as well.  Can't wait to get my replacement black and a new one in white"
827,"It was sent to me on time. And the product corresponds to my expectations.
Thank you"
829,"I really love this sandals, the fit true size. Got a lot of complements with them. The color is as you see it"
830,Awesome product!! You don't need to spend big bucks for some designer. Keeps out all the wind and rain. I bike commute and wear this over a suit and tie. Works great!!!Got product right on time. Highly recommend!
831,I bought these for my 92 Y/O Grandmother who is very picky about what she wears on her feet. She loves them. They are very soft and comfortable. Easy to put on and take off and soles are great for non slipping. We wear the same size and if she couldn't wear them I would have kept them anyway. Now I have to get me a pair
832,"I love this rainsuit.  It's comfortable, looks great and works well"
833,"These boots look so hot on!  I'm not one to wear heels much and was worried that I wouldn't be able to walk in them, but found no problems at all.  My honey was drooling.."
834,I have been very pleased with this item.  It is well made and is comfortable
835,It will definitely get her attention in the best possible way
836,"I bought Thorlo socks after a trip to Disney World. In spite of wearing cotton socks and well-broken-in sneakers, I developed really painful blisters on both feet. The trip was ruined. I read about these socks on line and decided to try them on my next vacation. They are really comfortable and I haven't had blisters again, even when on vacations that involve lots of walking. I use them all the time now, not just while on vacation. They may be a little pricey, but I think they're worth every penny"
837,I bought this item for my boyfriend for his tailgaiting experience this year since he has season tickets.  He LOVES everything about it - especially the fact that it is the Bears!  =
839,"First, order a size larger than you usually get, they seem to run small. I love the sleeve length on these and the fit and feel of the fabric. The cut is very flattering. I am going to buy more of these. You can't beat the price"
840,"I, like many many others, ordered the 4811 and 4911 when I read the article.  I ordered directly through herroom.com on 6/24.  I knew it was going to be a long wait, and they also sent me 3 e-mails during the summer to let me know that they hadn't forgotten my order, but the delays were significant due to the heavy demand.  They always gave me the option of cancelling my order, since they don't charge my card until they ship out the order.  I almost did, but my order finally came 9/10, and I must say that they really are the most comfortable thongs I've ever worn.  I've already placed another large order, as Christmas gifts for my friends!"
841,I liked the timeliness that the merchandise arrived. They fit my husband's feet well and he likes them. The only down side is that when he tried to tighten them the leather lace broke and so now we have to try to find something like it to fix the lace.
842,What can you say about a hat?  The hat is well made with no flaws.  Easy to shape the bream to how I like it right out of the box.  Willing to beat this hat is going to last a long time.  Well worth the money
843,"I will never understand why Reebok discontinued the original BB4600 high tops--they were simply the best ever made. PERIOD. Hopefully, Reebok will start making them again soon. These high tops (especially the ones from the 1980s-early'90s) were far better than comparable shoes from Nike, Puma, Pony and Converse--not surprisingly, they go for impressive prices at online markets like Ebay"
844,"Great jacket and easy to order on line and received before Christmas. You are great ,, Amazon.  All my purchases were great.  Jacket was exactly what we ordered, right size, color,etc.,  Thank yo"
846,I REALLY LIKED THIS SHIRT.THE COLORS ESPECIALLY.IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A EASIER WAY TO GET THE SIZE RIGHT.BUT I WOULD BUY IT AGAIN
847,I've bought this product twice and I absolutely love it.  It's very beautiful
848,"My grandson LOVED these because they were ""Cars"" shoes and it didn't hurt that they light up when he walks and stomps around"
849,"I ditched the bulky jewel cases for my cds a long time ago in favor of nice binders that would hold the disk and the artwork securely without taking up too much space.  Since my collection continues to grow much faster than I anticipated, I recently started looking to buy more binders.  Alas, the ones I already had (No Boundaries, from Wal-Mart of all places) don't seem to be available anymore, so a pretty exhaustive search of online options brought me to this item.  

Basically, this binder has pretty much everything I was looking for:  three ring construction, a sturdy zipper closure to keep discs safe and contained, and a sewn-in handle at the back so it's portable.  A plus about this particular model is that the rings are slightly oversized for the stated capacity, so there is the possibiity of expanding by buying more sheets.  I bought three, and they work great.  I will buy more - several more, because they are the best option there is at present.  

Let me tell you, however, what I don't like about them.  First, the cover is some sort of plastic or vinyl.  I can see this cracking or disintigrating in a couple of years, even with gentle treatment.  Second, there isn't a proper spine to the binder:  it's basically a single, flexible sheet that wraps around the outside but doesn't make square corners.  That means it will look  untidy on the shelf and also makes me question its long-term durability.  Third, the sleeves:  they are too tight to put the disc and the artwork in the same slot, the ones closest to the rings have their corners notched in to accomodate the rings, and the slits are oriented to the zipper side instead of to the top.   

Those drawbacks aside, I plan to buy more of these.  They are the best choice available now, but I wouldn't hesitate to ditch them if something better became available.  If you are looking for a safe, flexible, and smart place to store a lot of cds, this item should be at the top of your list."
850,"This is a Great Gown for the price. It's comfy, soft, and there is even a small bit of support for the big busted girls out there. Moreover, it's sexy! Hope yall enjoy"
851,"I really like these shoes!  The look is very current, kind of fun, while still professional enough to be able to wear them with a lot of different outfits.  I think they will be a very versatile addition to my closet.  I will also say for anyone who sometimes needs a slightly wider shoe (I usually buy most of my shoes at Payless because I can get more things in the wide width there), I was pleasantly surprised by the fit of these open-toed pumps.  They fit comfortably on my feet.  The satin-like fabric would not be my first choice, but they don't look too overly dressy"
852,"These briefs are awesome.  They are so soft and comfortable to wear.  I have always worn boxers, but now after trying these on, I'll wear them all the time and to school too.  No one even cares about tighty whities in the locker room.  More kids now are wearing briefs too.  So should everyone else"
853,i love the bag.  it is sturdy and strong without too many compartments thus not to much zipper and small in size.  my husband wears it everyday even on special occasions.
854,"I bought this robe and the silk pajamas for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day, both in a size large. The pajamas fit nicely, but the robe was WAY too big! I printed out the return label listing the reason for return as the product did not fit the description online. Amazon said that this was not their fault and deducted the cost of shipping from my refund, and did not offer the opportunity for an exchange. So, now I have to re-order the robe in a smaller size, and the price has gone up $7 since Valentine's Day. This would have been a good deal if it had run true to size, but because of misrepresentations made I will end up paying close to the full price listed. 
MORAL: Order one size smaller than you think you need."
856,"I am a international customer and every thing works fine, the quality of the product it's very good and the online purchase is cheaper than a local shop here in Venezul"
857,"Some people scoff, they say $100 + for boots, no way, too expensive! I have been wearing DR's for 10 years, and nothing else. Why? Because nothing holds up like DR. Martins. 

Oddly my first pair ever fell apart after a couple of weeks, the stiching just fell out, but I exchanged them and have never had that problem since.

The average pair last me 2 - 3 years of everyday, non-stop wear. I where them all year around, on the sales floor, wharehouse or office, and everywhere I go. They will not come apart!

I only get new ones when the old ones look worn and stretched, and when the soles start to wear smooth (14 - 18 months of 8 - 14hr / day wear, seven days a week!) and then I keep the old pair for another 14 - 18 months for working outside or any dirty job I have to do where I don't want to damage my good pair.

I got married in DR. Martins, pollished with a new double-breasted suite! They look great with everything! Jeans, cargos, Dress clothes, shorts! I bought my wife a pair of dress sandles nearly three years ago, they still look like brand new!

These boots are forever"
858,"Panties in front, thong in back, gorgeous band around the waist, can't ask for more than that in a panty. I like the way they feel, the hot way they look. My girlfriend Sara sure loves them and I can see why"
859,"These are great . Well made, did ok in the wash. They also did not split at the seam after wearing them 2x . They are still cool enough for summer, but nice and warm in winter and SERIOUSLY SOFT !!!!!! By a pair for your wife,yourself They are heaven"
862,"These are great socks.  In the description it mentions that they fit sock sizes 10-13.  I assume that is the same as shoe size, but it is not explained.  This, however, is an important point, since I wear a size 10 shoe.  I can wear the socks and I really like them but I wish they were a little smaller.  One size does not fit all."
863,"My daughter's school requires that they where white knee highs with their uniform.  I had an awful time searching the net to find any until I came across these.  They are very soft and comfortable.  My daughter only wants these types of socks from now on.  But from a Mom's point of view they are hard to keep white.  Even with soaking in bleach I can't get out any of the foot wear and tear discoloring.  Other than that, they're great"
865,"This item has a screen protector but doesn't have a protector for the click wheel. This is the only reason that I didn't give the item five stars. The leather is of good quality, and there is some padding to help protect you ipod if you were to drop it. It has a rotating belt clip which is nice. I also like that you can access the hold button, headphone jack, and USB port without having to remove the case. There is also a little pocket inside where you can hold a couple credit cards, perfect if you like to travel light :"
866,"I got custom fit for this bra at Nordstrom's and I am so happy that I purchased it - among others that day. I had lost 55 pounds and was looking to update my image and had gone through about 4 bra sizes on my way down. Hands down this was the best purchase - even better than the $65 I spent on the Le Mystere bra. It is unbelievably comfortable and since I am a ""light"" 34c it adds the perfect amount to make me a perfect C. Plus it gives me a ""bump"" and just the right amount of cleavage. I can even wear it with many of my plunging tops and feel sexy without being over the top. One thing to note is that it puts the breasts pretty close together - and since I am 5' 1"" and a size 2 that works well for me as I am pretty small framed. It took a bit to get used to ""them"" being so ""out there in front."" So if your breasts are set further apart then this might not be the right fit for you. I love it so much that I now have this in all 3 colors and 2 of the bare color as I am very fair skinned."
867,These were for my mom and they got here in a timely fashion and were what she wanted. Pleased with service
868,"I almost didn't order these ear muffs based on some other reviews, but I'm really glad I did. If you're looking for a simple ear muff, these are it and they are a great deal at only 5.69.  One of the other reviewers commented that they were poor quality and too thin.  They are thin because they are made with Thinsulate!  If you want something bulky, I guess you should order a product not made with Thinsulate."
869,"I was concerned that these silk PJ's would be really thin and on the cheap side. But to my surprise, they are much thicker then I thought they would be and feel like they will hold up rather well.  

My husband did NOT expect these and is quite pleased with them.  I am back tonight to order another pair in a different color now that I know they are worth the money I paid for them. Plus the fit was perfect.  I noticed others here said their large was to big so get a smaller size...and another person said the opposite.  (That confused me when I went to buy.) So I just went with my husbands normal size which is a XXL and it was absolutely perfect!  :)  My husband loves the feel of them and said this is by far is nicest pair of PJ's ever.  

The size is perfect, color bright & looks like it will hold up after many washings. Seams looked like quality sewing unlike some I have bought in the past.  I can't find anything I don't like about these.  

I need to get another pair here FAST before he wears these out. lol  Anyone thinking of buying these I can't help but think you will be quite pleased to say the least. 

Ja"
871,"At first, I was afraid to purchase underwear online, since it's difficult to get what you need even going to a store. I'm very pleased with these brassieres. For a reasonable price you get a high quality product. Soft, strong, durable and elegant material. Nice shape and practical clip on front. I recommend it 100%"
873,"Given the fact that I have not been able to EVER find a comfortable bra that also supported my D size chest (and my picky posture and displeasure for underwire), this bra has won the battle.  There's just a couple of quirks, but that could just be me.  When I tighten the straps, they eventually give way and losen up a bit.  I find myself adjusting them every 3-4 wears.  I'm considering sewing the straps permanently at that adjustment. 

I hand wash it in cold water with mild soap and hang to dry. Sometimes tumble on low heat or air tumble and the shape and size stay consistent.  I lost just a hair of weight in my breats and the bra fitted a little loser.  Because of this, vertical ""waves"" in the cup material appeared, but that was because there wasn't enough to fill the bra.  Once I gained that size back (unfortunately!) and filled the cup fully, the ridges disappeared.

I've had this one for 10 months and wear it every day, and it's still in great shape! When this one finally gives in, I'm definitely spending the money to buy another one"
874,"What a bargain, I bought this shoe on amazon for $29.99. Very unusual shoe I get a lot of compliments on it. I like the lace-to-toe design and is easy to get in and out because it's round shoelaces."
875,This jacket is so cute.. You can also wear it as a vest..It fits very true to size..I love it.
876,"This is my third pair of Crocs and I love every one of them.  This new ""Mary Jane"" style is the best!  Everyone wants to know where I got them"
877,"The quality of the product is good..

 i would always order a 
 1 or 2 waist sizes larger than regular pants size !!"
878,I am delighted with my new Birks.  They are the same excellent quality as any Birkenstocks and cost considerably less.  Whenever I need new ones (every 7 years!)I will get again get them through Amazon. I am on a small fixed income. What a deal! Thanks.
879,"I'm sure this product is GREAT because I've heard from several others and read on other sites that it works well and actually helps reduce the waistline, but I don't know first hand, yet.

I normally purchase only through Amazon, but I came across this company called Lauren Silva Group, and saw what I thought was a good price, jumping without looking at Amazon.com. Anyways, I bought it, shipping charges and all on the 18th. Later on, I go to Amazon because , when I'm bored I go to Amazon, lol. Imagine how annoyed I was when I saw it was the same price, but as you know Amazon has FREE SHIPPING on products over a certain amount, ALWAYS. I figured what's done is done, but I revisit laurensilva.com, and see in bold print FREE SHIPPING Dec 15th- 31st on orders over $50. I'm happy cuz I'm thinking, ""Great I didn't overpay"", I call customer service and she tells me ""Oh, I'm sorry about that that was a mistake on our part that should've said 19th not 15th"" then goes on to say ""My supervisor will call you to let you know about the refund tomorrow."" Received no call. I call the next day around two to hear from the supervisor that even though THEY put the 15th, it was an error and shouldn't have been there, and he wouldn't refund me the 5 bucks. How am I responsible for an error from YOU GUYS. Isn't that FALSE ADVERTISING? I'm so pissed. Now I have to call my credit card company, and might have to deal with them lying about it. I'm so angry.

Aside from being deceived, I was treated so poorly. How do people act like this? When I initially called, I had no idea it would turn into this, otherwise I would've had ""gathered evidence."" as my friends tell me. I hate to make a stink over 5 measly bucks, but you should've heard his condescending attitude when he said ""We won't be refunding you the shipping, but thank you for informing us of the error"" . Right now it's simply the principal"
884,"FIT IS PERFECT.  VERY COMFORTABLE.  4 STARS.   WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN.
                              MARY S"
885,"I was looking for a pink penny loafer that was wide enough (I wear a wide shoe) and comfortable for casual wear.  These are perfect.  Wide enough, comfortable and a nice color pink.  I would definitely buy another pair"
886,They are so comfortable that they feel like tennis shoes to me. The actual color is darker than what they appear online
888,I was a little hesitant after reading the other review but this compnay must have made great strides to improve!  The shirt was exactly as described and it got here in two days
889,"I tried this shoe at Shoe Carnival today. It was on sale for $49.99. Needless to say, I bought it right away at Amazon since it was $39.99! It fit me really well, I walked around the store and the strap stayed fastened, it was comfortable all around. I really like the mesh material at the toe area. I'm hoping this would mean that my toes will be well ventilated during warmer summer months! This is a very comfortable trendy shoe that is a good option for those wanting to look hip while wearing something comfortable to include more walking steps in their work day. It's also a great shoe for those not wanting to expose their toes wearing sandals but want them to breathe."
890,"I am delighted with this bag.  It's the perfect size, and has numerous pockets and zipper compartments.  The leather is soft and pliable.  Highly recommended"
892,"Wonderful product!  Small, compact and keeps ears warm even during high wind chills"
893,It IS the only underwear I will ever use.  The quality of the brand speaks for itself
894,"These are so cool.  I call them my bloomers.  They decrease the bulk in my clothing because they serve as both panties and a slip!  So it saves money too.  They can also be trimmed to a custom length for you because of their ingenious design.  In additon, they protect that tender inner thigh area when you're wearing a dress.  My usual size is 10-12.  I got a size L which works for me. They're a win-win"
895,My daughter needed black gym shorts for PE but all of the shorts I could find were shorter than my modest 13 year wanted to be seen in.  These were a nice mid thigh length without looking like boys shorts.  We were both happy with the quality and fabric.  They did take a little long to ship
896,"To begin, this package arrived way ahead of schedule and with no problems.  The skin fits the 30gb just fine and the wall charger works well.  I haven't timed it, but I think it charges faster than USB.  I haven't used the car charger yet, but I would assume it works just as well as the wall adapter.  The only reason my rating was 4 stars instead of 5 is that I ordered the green skin for my green Zen Vision:M and the colors do not match exactly.  I might have preferred the clear skin but besides the looks I am satisfied with everything else, very functional and the price can't be beat"
897,"I purchased these because they looked low-profile to fit on my feet inside my playboat...and they do (great), but they also rock just kickin' around the yard, town, playing in puddles w/ my kids...great Keen shoe.
Super comfortable, and so lightweight you can barely feel them.  I want some more colors"
898,"This is the best case that I have found for the new shuffle.  It protects well, and I got it for a great price"
899,"It's alright if you know how to use it.  It tends to roll at the ends and its a short shirt. Don't get it if you are not willing to wear a shirt underneath it or willing to show off your tummy.  But it is soft, cool and different from any piece of article in your closet, i guarrantee that!

I just bought it, and i have been experimenting on differnet styles.  Its pretty neat actually.

Hope this helps, i think everyone should get one, just for fun :-"
901,"Although I did have a tough time with the more flimsy constitution of this top, the front lace-up was a plus and my boyfriend's reaction was even better! What is it with guys and stuff that laces up? 
Other than that I would say that if you need major support from a bra this might not be for you. Also, if you are on the larger side width wise this might actually be a good purchase since it is lace-up and therefore adjustable in a wider range"
903,"Bought it for my father for Christmas and he loved it. Hey, if he's happy with it, then so am I"
904,"These socks are really thick, and well made. The color never fades and they don't ball up when washed like cheaper socks do. They last as long as your child fits in them, even longer. These are wonderful for wearing pants or dresses. Very well made, and worth the price"
905,Well made and comfortable.  Rockports seem to run about half a size small though so I would recommend ordering a half size large than normal especially if you intend to wear the  shoes with socks.
906,"I have to say that I liked the crotchless French Knichers (also by Love Fifi) better and that I'll probably buy a ton of them, but I'll get a pair or two of these as well, because there are sometimes in the bedroom when you just want to play the Devil and everybody knows Satan always wears red. This is the last review tonight. We've had mabye a bit to much to drink, a bit of harmless fun for under a hundred dollars each, and we all got to record a bit here about what we thought about these very sexy undies. It has been fun and I hope we can do it again sometime"
907,"The gloves were exceptional. Very good quality.  They seemed to run just a little large, but not enough to get a smaller size"
908,"This really came in handy on our recent travels. everything is right there and handy.
Regular airline tickets fit nicely, preprinted airline tickets from home computer takes some work to get it into the pouch. Very pleased with the product overall"
909,"I have 3 pairs of Sightsees and want more!  I have a narrow foot and need arch support to the extent of wearing orthotics in some of my shoes.  These shoes are NOT narrow (yet not wide), but because of the Velcro strap and arch support, I am able to wear these.  And, I don't need the orthotics!  

They are extrememly cool and comfortable... suitable for being on your feet all day.  Because of their slight Euro look, they go with almost anything.  In other words, you can wear them with dresses or with gauchos or to the gym.  I've found them in bronze and silver, and lots of other great colors.  They aren't cheap, but a great shoe at that.  These are probably my absolute favorite shoes.  I live in mine and would wear them more often if I had more colors! :)  By the way, I'm in my late 40s and a grandma--though I don't look like it.  I get tons of compliments on these shoes from college students and other moms and grandmas!"
910,My son loves the jersey - a little pricey but a nice jerse
911,"Wow! is about all I can say about these boots... And it's about time sneaker companys have gotten involved in military/ law enforcement footwear. Tall for good ankle support, lightweight, strong and very, very comfortable! I feel like I'm wearing a pair of New Balance 470 cross training sneakers. I had to buy two pairs since I can't imagine ever owning any other type or brand of tactical footwear ever again after these! Strange that sizing is available in only regular or wide on several web sites but the ones I have are clearly labeled medium width on the box? You will not be disappointed! find at a retailer to try on and see for yourself you'll pay at least $10-$20 more anywhere else"
912,"I got the item in a reasonable amount of time.  The quality was great and it had the seals just like it said.  I was pleased with the item, the price and the delivery"
913,Quick service for a shoe that has been discontinued and hard to find in a size 8/black.  No complaints.. great service.  great price
914,"The slippers are what I expected. With only a month, I can only say they do the job"
915,"My wife loves this visor.  It stays on, doesn't pinch and doesn't leave a mark or indentation"
916,"These are the most comfortable underwear I have ever worn. They are so soft and flexible, it almost feels like you aren't even wearing underwear. I plan on purchasing more of this item"
917,It was scheduled for delivery dec 26 and it actually came days before. Since it was a gift I couldn't be more pleased
919,I wish I would have had these right after giving birth.  They are great when you have to wear pads all of the time in the beginnning.  Disposable pads are thick and show through your clothes.  These feel really good on sore nips if you refrigerate them.  They did not work well for me when I had to go longer at night without feeding.  They leaked the first couple of days my body was getting used to 5 or 6 hours without feeding.  I will now give these to every breastfeeding friend as a shower gift
920,"I have two pair, both white and black, that I use only for dancing. The black are a simple design with minimal decoration. I even have a backup pair, just in case. Dancing about 6 nights per week they are super comfortable. I have a hard time finding ""real"" dance shoes in size 11 wide. Their sizing is accurate, they fit beautifully and the best bargain in dancing shoes I have been able to find."
921,"These jeans fit perfect in every way. Just enough stretch to conform to my curves without being constricting. The classic fit in the hip and thigh is perfect for me because my thighs are large. Most other boot cut jeans are slim through this area. Also the dark wash is perfect for making an outfit look classy while being casual.

One drawback is that you can't tell they are designer jeans. There's no logo or anything to indicate that these are DKNY, if I'm paying the price for designer jeans I'd like some indication of them being DKNY"
922,I was so impressed with the quality and correct sizing for this suit.  My little guy looked so grown-up and handsome in his new suit!! Thanks so much !
923,Perfect shirt....They have all colors and all sizes for very low price....I bought T-shirts on here for only 2.66 in a mens XL and a rare color!!!!!!!....Great Product For Low Pric
924,"I bought these for my husband who is very reluctant to ever buy any jeans other than his Levis 550's.  The Riggs workwear jeans are well made, and fit ok, but there is much room in the seat where most guys don't need it.  The inner part of the front pockets also show when worn as they just don't stay in place.  Other than that, they have been good jeans so far"
925,I went through every brand of running shoes .  I am tall and have a large frame and I tend to go through running shoes rather quickly.  When I discovered Brooks about 4 years ago it was Heaven sent.  Yes these shoes are expensive compared to others but you get your moneys' worth and hey spend money are your feet! We abuse them everyday.  They suppport my whole foot and I have not lost any toenails as with others.  I now run for fitness and not races.  These shoes last me about 6 months.  So if you are in searching mode I HIGHLY recommend these shoes.
926,"I buy these shoes for my son all the time and he loves them.  My only complaint is that you can't throw them into the washing machine and end up with ""like new"" shoes like you could back in the early 70's.  It bothers me as well that they are not made in the US.  But nothing is anymore, or so it seems"
927,"great flats! Compact and small for those who have too many shoes already. The only thing with these shoes are the elastic part starts hurting the back of my my foot, but only happens if you wear them for a long period of time."
928,"These are stylish and nice and perfect to wear under a pair of cutoff Levi's. My cutoffs are so faded, so frayed, so, well you know. So when I peal them off to reveal this Butterfly Lace up Panty (in Black with the pick laces on the back) it's like an instant transformation from outdoor girl to bedroom girl. We only had two colors at our lingerie party, white and the black and pink models, but I can imagine all the colors would be nice too."
930,"I purchased these slippers for my husband as a gift. He just loves them. I bought a 13EEE, he normally wears a medium and hoped these would fit, they did perfectly. He likes the idea he can go outside with slippers and they are very sturdy and well made. A great slipper, you can't go wrong if you purchase these. I will buy them again when this pair wears out."
931,"Pretty dammm Hot pair of boots, the buckles could have been a little longer for my calfs. God I love these boots!!!! Simply the best !!!"
932,I bought these shoes to wear at a friend's wedding. I danced in them all night and they didn't even hurt. I was surprised and pleased to find a dress shoe that was both comfortable and beautiful. I've since bought two other pairs of shoes by Kenneth Cole and I love them. I would buy these again.
933,"This looks very cute for my one year old son, matching most of his outfits.  Very supportive and soft for his prewalk feet.  I will always buy this brand for him. It is simply the best"
934,I was looking for a good quality pair of shoes with leather soles.  Leather sole shoes are getting harder and harder to find in stores.  The Bostonian line of shoes at Amazon.com filled the bill for me.  They are excellent quality at an affordable price
936,"My online shoe shopping tip: Buy a half size bigger than your normal size.
If it's a little too big, you can always add inserts to achieve a better
fit.  I also search the web for additional consumer reviews.

PROS:
This pointy toed boot looks really sexy - A great bargain for 30 bucks!
It's an easy to put on short boot. 
(It goes up to the bottom of my calf - I'm 5'5)
The leather is shiney and has a seamless look.  
Stains will wipe right off.
I'd recommend these with a nice pair of jeans or even for young
professionals to wear with their slacks.
Relatively comfortable.  I personally wouldn't wear them all day long.

CONS:
Leather IS stiff.  Doesn't really bend with the leg when walking.
I think that is what the previous negative review was referring to.  
The inside of the shoe has a nicer softer leather.
The zipper is not the best quality.

Hope this helps you make a better shopping decision!

937,This is the best purchase ever... it's really comfortable and it did covered all my expectations! I live in a tropical weather and it works on perfection... it's warm and don't let cold get in at night
939,"I could not believe the price!  The three cases are very protective, and the shipping from My Gear Store was very fast"
940,"cute & cozy boot- it is lined throughout the whole boot (toes & all) the leather is not of the highest quality, but considering how inexpensive they are it is worth the price (bought a pair last season too & the heel wore out)...compartively speaking i own uggs too & they are equally warm, however these boots are less clunky...i get compliments on the boot all the time"
942,This is a good quality pajama set and was worth the price I paid with an Amazon discount.  Be forewarned that the color is a really bright red though
943,"Love Love Love these shoes! they are not nearly as green as they seem online, more like brown olively color. I have these shoes in black/purple too they are so comfortable and perfect for so many occasions. I think i prefer these brown ones now though..."
944,"Pros: you won't notice you have this on after the first 5 minutes...strap is right width. Pouch is perfect for supporting your boys and keeping everything secure, but with plenty of room. Fabric is very soft. Cut is very low in front and back, which is nice if you're not into advertising your underwear preferences to the world! This is a great athletic thong...get this one. 

Cons: Initially feels too tight. Fit is fairly tight. 

I've owned about 8 different kind of thongs and this initially wasn't my favorite, but now I am throwing out most of the others besides this one. Also try the mesh thong with brazillian back for a more ""casual...roomier"" fit when support isn't a main goal. The silk version of the extreme is ok, but the fabric is too stretchy and doesn't offer the support of this cotton.

Order same size as your underwear"
945,"My first pregnancy I tried several styles of belts, most of which had a wide band in back. I am short, have a short midriff, and am overweight, so wider belts would roll from the top down.  I never had that problem with this belt.  Unfortunately, this pregnancy I am entering my 3rd trimester and have finally out grown the 1X belt, and the store I purchased it from is now closed.  I was thrilled when I found this on Amazon.com in a larger size.  

I recommend making it little snug in the mornings and then loosening it throughout the day as needed.  The most appealing feature for me is that this band is completely adjustable to give you the support you need for the different activities you will be doing throughout the day.  Any time you start needing the extra support, just slightly tighten the side straps.  When you start relaxing or if the belt starts feeling a little tight, just loosen it up a bit.  It's quick and easy to work with, and if one side needs more support than the other, just make that one side a bit more snug.  It's AWESOME!

I am a technology education specialist, so I'm on my feet for, many times, 16 hrs a day training and supporting hospitals with their new computer programs.  I couldn't have survived even my First Trimester without this belt.  I raise it a little higher in the back so that I have complete lower back support and belly support.  There were days when I forgot to wear my belt that I almost couldn't walk after only 4 hrs of work due to lower back pain that would eventually extend down to my fanny and legs.  My legs would litterally give out from underneath me until I could rub and relax my lower back for a while.  When you are working with doctors in the surgery room or doing rounds with them this is NOT a good thing.  As long as I wore my belt, I NEVER had a problem.  

I strongly recommend this product"
946,"Best sock in performance that I have ever tried.  I buy them in bulk and have never been dissappointed.  No sagging, no defects.  The only reason I toss them is that they fade to gray after a long life of use.

One of the few products that once you try them you never have to worry about this item in your wardrobe again.  If they ever stopped making them, I would buy a 100 pairs just to know I would have them for my liftime.  

There...I actually wrote a review on socks!"
947,"Was shipped very promptly.
     Not the largest man's umbrella but well designed.
Looks like someone really studied how umbrellas can wreck themselves by blowing inside out. So that this one won't"
949,This shoe is so much better than the picture shown. The red is just perfect. The picture does not do it justice....and you just cant beat the price.
950,"It comes with the typical Bostonian comfort fit, and much softer than it looks!  I'd planned on spending the first week breaking it in before my trip, but it was hardly necessary"
951,"Received sandals very fast and fit perfectly.  Wish the straps would stay up so I can slip on faster, but overall a good buy"
952,"You will never have to worry about your ties when traveling again.  Wildties Tie Winder is complete.  You know which tie you are grabbing by the clear plastic.  The ties stay wound and come out without any crinks or knots or any other damage.  It is easily workable, both in winding up and taking the tie out.  This will keep your ties looking professional and crisp."
953,"I found that the most useful way to wear this product was under my maternity pants to help keep them from sliding down my increasingly round belly.  I didn't like wearing it over my pants at all.  I found that after sitting down or even walking awhile, my pants would slide down my belly and the bella band would roll up my belly.  There were alot more clothing adjustments in public when I was wearing it over my pants"
955,"I was taking an Alaska Cruisetour and looking for something that would be warm, had a hood, would be light and easy to pack.  I was also shopping at the last minute.  They were out of the color I originally requested, but called me immediately, we changed colors and I had the item in my hands within a couple of days.  It was perfect for what I needed!  It was easy to carry and the hood was zipped inside the collar.  I was very pleased with the product.  It was a man's windbreaker, so I just ordered a medium and it fit perfectly. I would definitely buy from them again"
956,"This product was great...I bought two for a gift for Christmas, this one and another one from a brand name that cost 5 times as much and I returned the more expensive one...this one had a lot better quality so I was happy! I'm thinking of buying one for myself now!"
957,IT WAS VERY ROOMY AND THE COLOR WAS AS DESCRIBED. ONCE AGAIN AMAZON HAS DONE A MARVELOUS JOB. MANY THANKS!!!!
958,"I received my boots yesterday and I love them! They are very feminine. I was happy I read other's reviews prior to ordering my boots, I am typically between sizes and I order the larger size. The larger size fits like a glove with trouser socks but thicker socks would make them too tight. Thanks to everyone who wrote a review"
959,"I purchased a pair and have been using it everyday from the past six months. The shoes are very comfortable and look very professional. Love them. 

Strong and tough.
Not to heavy. Has good grip on snow."
961,Dickies always makes the best apparel....not only useful and extremely durable...it is stylish as well
962,"..it's everything i expected. fits like true size, and the real thing looks sooo much better than the photos.
plus it's soo comfortable. I can walk all day in these babies and i dont even feel a pinch in my feet. it's absolutely awesome :"
963,"I like this boot. It is durable, warm and practical. I leave them loosly tied so that I can slide my feet into them and go. Good price too"
964,This is a great casual shirt. Very cute! It does run true to size. Checking the provided sizing chart is a good idea if you are not sure of the size. I wear a 10-12 so I got the extra large because I do not like my clothes snug & it fits me fine
966,"I wouldn't say these shoes are exactly true-to-size. I'm a size 10 and ordered as such, however these shoes were a bit snug. They stretched a bit, but, being silk, not as much as the $3 cotton variety I'd bought at a hippie store. However, these silk shoes are dressier and sturdier, and when they get dirty or smelly, you can throw them in the washing machine. I'm not sure if I was supposed to, but I did and they survived, good as new."
967,"These are comfortable and give a smooth profile under trousers, however, they are too high to wear with many low-rise jeans and pants.

Still, good value for the price"
969,"As a 37 y.o. biathlon who's pretty fit, I'm sick of wearing those mid-length, baggy swim trunks I've had since I was...well, forever.  When I saw Casino Royale (new James Bond flick), I realized I wanted to get some of those 50's-era boxy shorts.  That's exactly what these are.  Very cool.  Also, prompt shipping and excellent support from Andrew Christian.  Update your beach look to something other than 1982"
970,"I have seen pictures of moccasins much like these while researching Ojibwe/Chippewa history, so decided to order a pair.  They have the soft sole and a foam insole for comfort, they are a medium width but work well for a somewhat narrower foot because the tie is adjustable. They seem to be very well made of good quality materials at a reasonable price.  They are very comfortable, they were promptly shipped, I am 100% pleased with this transaction"
972,"I love them. However, I was expecting something a bit different when I opened the box. The color is hard to match but no one ends up, looking at the color just the really cool 60's style shoe"
973,"I own this halter top in black & white.  The colors are vibrant & the fabric quality is very good.  This style runs small, so order 1 size up for a comfy fit. This company's customer service rocks"
974,"We LOVE this sling!!!  Often wonder what we'd do without it as it works it's calming, sleep inducing magic on our son about 99% of the time. It seems like as soon as he gets in he's in his own little cozy womb-like world and he just drifts off... It can be hard on the back in the shoulder blade area, as well as on the shoulder if used for a long stretch of time, but keeping the two layers as spread out (vs. bunched up) as possible generally remedies the problem.  It's easiest (I think) to put the baby in if you guide their head in first, and it's also easy to switch shoulders or the hand baby in sling to another person.  This is our most used piece of baby gear by far - my husband even gardens with it on!  Our son has loved it since he was 4 days old - he's 2 mos now and 15 lbs and there's still plenty of room for him in it. Also, it works well to breastfeed baby while they are in it which is an added bonus when you are out and about. I would also recommened NOT getting a light color (ours was a gift) because it starts looking a little funky after you dribble your dinner down it a few times"
975,"Great quality - real thing.
Although knock-offs are everywhere you CAN tell the difference"
976,"This is Undergear's standard thong offering.  It's basic cotton, which isn't as comfortable as Undergear's Extreme Thong, but it's a good fit.  The price is not prohibative, so stock up if you want to build a basic collection of thong underwear.  The only thing I've noticed is that, because cotton is not as durable as other fabrics, the edges fray after some time"
977,"I have been looking for a pair of Docs for a while. I know they are a new globalized company, and I am not necessarily against that.

I am disappointed that you can't get a better range of colors. I've had a few blue pairs and a lovely green. But colors are not really available now except on high tops emblazoned with the brand name. An abomination for sure!

These shoes are very comfortable and apparently well-made. My single quibble with the black pair I got here on amazon has to do with the flimsiness of the tongue. I like a nice strong tongue. (And who doesn't?) Whatever they saved on material here may have been a mistake. On the other hand, maybe the sole will wear out first (or it will be a dead heat).

Never thought I'd buy shoes online, but amazon and the Doctor made it happen."
978,"I've gotten many compliments on these shoes!  I love how they look, they are made of a soft material so they are comfortable, but still cause sore feet after shopping all day in them.  But that's the cost of looking cute"
979,"Sexy, practice, confortable, discrete under clothing.
I had a couple in 98 and I just loved them. I`m glad I found it again
I just whish it could still have in color Champagne"
980,"these are so great, and keep my baby's feet warm.  She even slept with them on with no problem.  She's been a master at getting her socks off up until now.  They also protect her feet as she is starting to stand and was breaking toenails.  She's chewing on the toes but I haven't seen any scuff marks yet, so they are holding up very well"
981,"I purchased these boots because I have another  pair of Aerosoles, that I've been wearing for almost 3 years that are SO comfortable. The heel is a bit high for me, which makes my food slide down to the frong (maybe they run a little big)? I do get a bunch of compliments on these shoes though. Overall, I am not dissapointed."
984,"These are some very nice shoes. I love the blue and black ones. These really should get some more publicity because the are better than all other basketball shoes. They are also very comfortable. If you want to get some high quality shoes for a good price, get T-Macs!!!!!!!!!!"
985,"Very nice shoe, right size and very comfortable.  The strap is nice and the big buckle gives an interesting touch."
986,quick fast service. Love the jacket and will purchase from them again
987,Very nice terry robe and received early. Will buy from this company again very soon
988,"Just received my KCR men's Simply Western Harness boots today!  This is my second pair of boots for this particular brand.  The KCR men's Team Circle boots were one size larger than stated.  This Simply Western, on the other hand, fits perfectly.  I wear size 7 and ordered a pair of size 7.  Very stylish, very light, very well made.  5 days ago, Dec.6, I went to the M??y's department store and saw the exact same model and brand selling for $145 plus tax.  I purchased this pair at Amazon for $69.90, tax and shipping free!  The pair in the department store have blacken or darkened toe and heel for the brown color model (in which I don't like!).  This brown pair from Amazon have even brown finish throughout.  Looks fantastic, very comfortable, made in Romania!  I give it 5 stars and 2 thumbs way up"
989,"My search for the perfect gym bag is like my search for the perfect hair drying, yoga mat, organizing products, garlic press (Zyliss) etc. Fortunately, my search for the perfect gym bag is officially over. The Ogio Locker Bag is brilliant and the inventor should get some sort of award. K.R.T. Seeley's review sums it up pretty well, but here are a few things to add. For one thing, the shoe area also nicely accommodates a hair dryer or curling iron. One of the reasons this matters is that it points up a critical advantage of the shelf separating the shoe area from the upper part of the bag: while the shelf is sturdy, it's also adjustable. It goes only low enough to allow for a pair of shoes, but it can also be raised to allow for other items. 

Next, while it's very nice that the front end panel has all these handy little pockets for things like shampoo, brush, and whatnot, actually including containers that fit the pockets shows a real consideration for their users. Another plus is the number of outside pockets, several of which are not only zippered but waterproof as well, for, say, wet bathing suits. 

Before I bought this bag, I called my gym and yes, I really did make them go measure the width of their lockers. The magic number was 12"". At 8"", the Ogio bag fits in with room to spare. 

For raqueteers (sports, not crime), there are several loops on one of the end panels for holding racquets and a couple of others I haven't quite figured out yet. 

For yogis and yoginis, yes, the adjustable strap on the end panel can accommodate a yoga mat, if it's not too thick. 

An outer side pocket nicely accomodates my workout journal (yes, I'm a fanatical record keeper), as well as my beloved NewGrips (just do a search on NewGrip) which are indispensable for rowing (notoriously hard on the hands) and weight-lifting (and about a billion other things for those of us with carpal tunnel, arthritis, or, in my case, both). Another outside pocket is perfect for a CD player and headphones. 

The only improvement I can imagine for this bag would be adjustable straps on the bottom to hold larger, rolled towels or mats. Unfortunately, even Title9 doesn't seem to carry that one anymore. 

In other words, this bag is the best on the market. It's a bit pricey but it's worth absolutely every cent. I suspect that quite a lot of my friends will be getting the Ogio for Christmas and birthdays and whatnot. Congrats, Ogio, and thank you very, very much"
990,This inexpensive windbreaker is attractive and does the job.  My only minor issue was that there was a little too much fabric around the zipper so care must be taken in zipping and unzipping
991,"Great jacket.  A little less warm than I thought, but perfect for spring or fall and mildly cold weather"
992,These are so cute. Plus the background is glittery which you can't tell from the picture. My daughter loves them
993,THESE ARE THE SOFTEST - MOST COMFORTABLE FLIPS FLOPS I HAVE FOUND IN YEARS!   YOU CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE EITHER
994,"I started wearing these shoes when I was 19. Five years later, I've gone through two pairs (about to buy my third), but they've been my one and only pair of shoes. I just haven't had the desire to wear anything else. I've worn them for nearly 12 hours a day, every single day, year-round, working at a job during the day that requires constant movement, and then walking around the city at night. You can't really tell by looking at them that they've been literally everywhere with me. They could use a bit of a polish, but other than that, nothing's worn down. I suppose if I wore more shoes, I would only need one pair of these, and they'd last longer. But thats not stopping me."
995,"I like underwear that does its job with minimal impact.  These define that.  I hate boxers, and ""tighty-whities"" are too much fabric for what they do.  This is like wearing an athletic supporter.  Comfortable and high-quality."
996,This was a very professional elegant combo set for the price. I have yet to find anything that can compare
997,"Hello,

     I bought one and really satisfied on the looks, fit and materials on this sunglasses. Highly recommended.

Leonides Litiatco of the Philippines"
998,Nice shirt. Well made. Good price. What more can I say
999,This shoe was lovely online but was even more gorgeous in reality. Every time I wear it I get compliments. It is really nice
1000,I have used key cases for years and have been looking for a good replacement for some time when I decided to use the Net. Low and behold I found one here. It was exactly what I was looking for and in my hands within a few days of ordering. I would recommend the store for prompt service and good product
1001,Excellent buy!!!    It was much roomier than I thought it would be and it just the coolest bag ever.  Well made and I Love it
1002,"Go for it. Your goggles may fog up, though. If so, use medical tape just between the top part and your skin to prevent air from escaping from the upper part and up to your goggles. I tried them in the very cold and still was ok. And if it gets too warm, you can bring the nose part lower to your chin. Perfect to use wit a hemet. Good price too"
1003,"I've worn these panties for years.  They are comfortable, long-lasting, and attractive.  Best of all, they never wedge up on me.  Everyone needs cotton underwear, and as far as I'm concerned, Jockey makes the best.  I will keep wearing these as long as they make them"
1004,Trying to find a great present for my grandson is quite challenging.  These were a smashing hit!  I wouldn't be surprised if he slept with them on!
1005,"My 8 month old has his dad's build, tall and slim, so finding pants that are long enough and still stay up has been a challenge. These pants  fit the bill.  The material is ultra-comfy, and the colors go great with onesies from lots of different companies.  They've also been through the wash numerous times (washed with Dreft), without fading or loosing their durability. A great product for the price."
1006,"Like many people, I bought these shoes after reading the high endorsement by Tennis magazine. They're definitely not the cheapest around but they are great performers.  I'm a 3.5 level player and I could tell my footwork improved a lot while wearing these shoes. Took a while to break in"
1007,"This wallet arrived very quickly. It is lovely, soft leather. I like the fact that it is zippered on three sides, keeps everything in the wallet. I am female, and while wallets are traditionally a male style, I wanted something that wasn't just a coin purse or a typical woman's purse - you know, with the clasp pouch for coins and dividers etc, b/c I find those very cumbersome. This is compact, light, it has plenty of pockets, slots and dividers inside - that zip again comes in handy if you fill up all the spaces inside it ensures you won't lose anything.
I gave it four stars instead of five just b/c the coin pocket (while strategically placed and pleasingly compact) is a little hard to get your fingers in to put coins in and take them out quickly, it's kind of tight. Also, the center divider (for your pictures or drivers license etc.) sometimes gets in the way when you want to zip the wallet up - like if you are in a hurry to get out of the line at Starbucks and you are struggling to shove your change in the little slot and zip it up!
But this really is a great purse/wallet. I love it and the soft leather, which the interior of the wallet is also made of - it's not just a cheap fabric filler inside, looks and feels really nice"
1008,I love these boots!  they are so cute and stylish and they look great with my jeans tucked in.  They will be a great asset this winter for sure with my brown leather coat.  I recommend these boots but they run a size small
1009,"Bought these shoes for my husband.  He always loves the Bostonian brand shoes.  He had no problem with a need to break in these shoes.  He wore them all day the first day and he says they were completely comfortable.  The shoes are excellent quality, good value for the price and are really great looking.  Dressy enough for a suit but casual enough for khakis and a shirt"
1010,"I only use the protective case/skin, not the armband or belt clip.  I primarily wanted protection for the screen, which this provides.  The screen protector and skin fit perfectly and were easy to apply.  I can easily access all ports and manipulate all controls with them applied/installed.  I have not used the armband, but it looks pretty sturdy.  I paid $18.90 for this item including $5.95 shipping"
1011,This is a cool little onesie.  It was only $3 so I bought it cause I thought my husband would like it.  He did.  It fit good and I have no complaints
1012,"I am happy with this product, excellent price, a quelity material and great looking, very confortable for the beach or summe"
1013,The robe was made of a very high quality fabric and held up very well! The color and tecture of the silk was truly beautiful.
1014,First my only complaint is the key chain type holder for the stays keeps coming loose and they fall all over. Other then that the stays thmeselves are great. Customer service from the company was 5 stars
1015,This product arrived on time and works terrific. Couldn't find the silicone case anywhere in town--only one place had the car charger and it was $30 by itself. This whole package was a GREAT deal. The case really protects the Gigabeat
1017,"I just got this shirt in a small in black and I like it.  I was a size small (2-4) before I got pregnant, I am now 8 months pregnant and about 40 + pounds gained, and the shirt fits snug and cozy to my standards.  If the shirt was a bit longer (I am on the tall side 5'7""), and maybe a bit thicker cotton, I would have given it 5 stars."
1018,Very comfortable - looks great - makes it easy to move around in bed
1019,"Fits and feels good, esp. for doing a swim race.  Highly recommend this.  

Be careful when wearing board shorts with velcro zipper straps over this material.  The velcro from the board shorts tend to stick very easily to the material of this swim trunks.  Have to be careful when removing the velcro from any shorts or pants.  I had this happen and the velcro almost damaged the swim trunks when I was removing it."
1020,"When I first bought these over the summer as a last resort before I went to Europe, I was skeptical and I wasn't sure if I liked them or not. Now that I'm back in the states to the cold winters of the Northeast, I've decided that I really do like them. They're design lifts everything out of the way, which is very comfortable - no re-adjusting necessary. They're a good buy"
1021,Stylish and comfy... What more could you ask for?  My husband was very pleased
1022,This is my favorite backpack. It never fails me...even though I don't think a backpack can..
1024,"This carrying case is exactly that, A Carrying Case, and has enough space for 3 games + cleaning cloth. The LCD protectors are pretty difficult to use but this set for the DS lite is perfect in fitness and price. This set is necessary for th DS Lite.."
1025,Fit well.  Great for all kinds of athletic workouts.  I'm ready to buy a couple more pairs
1027,"I've been trying to find a decent bra for ages: one that would be attractive *and* hold things in place at the same time. I was afraid I'd be doomed to the old 1950s bulletproof, cone-shaped bra-in-a-box styles forever...and those are anything but seductive.(I recently changed bra sizes from one that stores carried in multiple styles/selections to a 34DDD, which you have to order online or have made- at astronomical prices.) I was hopeful about this bra, because it was decently priced~~and I wasn't disappointed. The underwire and 4 hooks give excellent hold, the cups are deep enough to cover everything (and keep things pointing up where they belong), and the criss-cross lacing between the cups gives it just enough of the peek-a-boo allure to make it sexy. Even though this bra is a sedate white, it still passed the husband whistle-test. :) Not bad!"
1028,"I disagree, this is a great bra, if you want a good full support bra.  I am a 36 DD, tried it on, and I plan to buy it soon..."
1029,"These BDU pants were just right.  Comfy, useful, and strong.  Love the color, too"
1030,Good quality product at very reasonable price. Postage was quick even though I'm in the UK. All round good service
1031,The name doesn't lie: it feels like you're wearing next to nothing!  The fabric feels so good on the skin it is incredible.  Once you get moving you'll forget you even have them on!  This is how all boxer briefs should be.  It fits right to your body and the only fabric inbetween the front and back is what's needed to hold your stuff
1032,"I haven't ever owned a pair of these before and I became interested after a friend of mine got some.  I started looking around online and found some pretty outrageous prices for single pairs, and when I came upon this deal I couldn't pass it up! I love them, I drive a school bus, and I'm by far the coolest driver in the lot with these!

Thanks for a great deal"
1033,Combines the Clarks comfort with a sassy heeled sandal--look as good with the little black dress as with jeans
1034,recoment this product. Because it have good quality and good price. buy it
1035,I love these shoes...the heel is perfect for capris.  I bought the Champagne and they are perfect with almost anything.
1036,"I bought the black and pink set.  It's great that this item has basically everything you need to protect and wear your new nano.  The pink is quite transparent, which didn't look very good on my black ipod, but the black is nice and opaque.  Make sure you don't get any dust on the sticky side of the screen protector as you apply it, because if you do, bubbles will definitely result and it doesn't look very good.  I had to take the screen protector off and wash it in water about three times in order to get it clean enough to put on.  The good thing is, you can wash it and it will stick again.  Also, any bubbles that are not directly over the screen are covered by the case.  Overall, I think it's a good deal for the price since you're getting everything you need in one item"
1037,"This is, by far, the most comfortable pair of unders I've ever worn. Over the years, I've gone with boxers and with briefs, and in the boxers vs. briefs contest, both are losers compared to the Contour Thong. There's no elastic to chafe the legs yet there is full support. The Contour Thong has a Y thong back, and you don't need to have the body of an International Male/Undergear model to wear these. For any guy with an open mind, I recommend these -- just buy one or two pairs and give a try"
1038,"I love wearing those tank tops with shelf bras or summer dresses that can't be worn with a bra...but the nipple issue was quite vexing. I didn't feel comfortable with any nip protrusion...the only disadvantage in having implants is that they tend to be a bit nipply. But, problem solved. These things rock"
1039,My husband thinks this is the best invention and the price is great.  I buy several at time and they each last for several months
1040,"This is undoughtably the best and most comfortable shoe I have ever owned. They comform to your feet readily and wear like iron. You'll feel like you'r ""walking on a cloud"". Plus they look great and you'll be proud to wear them."
1041,"The main beef I have with tube socks is many will state that they are ""over the calf"", but they really aren't. These, however, are actually long enough to reach my knees, and I'm 6'4"". So if you're looking for a tall sock, these would be the best ones for the price. I've had them for about a year now and no holes yet either"
1042,I got these at a really good price so I don't care that they are not really leather.  They are cute and just what I needed.  They are also comfortable.  I bought them in mahogany too
1043,"The shorts I purchased were very light weight was was an excellent quality considering the heat. These shorts come in even sizes up to 42'. These shorts have elastic on each side which lets the shorts expand during the day, particularly when you are working and your pockets get full or your work belt gets added weight.

These shorts were the most excellent buy of this type that I have ever made"
1044,"Wow! This is the first review of this thong?
Unbelieveable! 
I am a ""newbie"" to the thong market after growing up wearing what my Mom told me to wear; cotton briefs (tighty whiteys). 
Consider me liberated! 
After going through my initial ""ordering frenzy"" of thong underwear (much to my wife's ""you're developing a mid-life thong fetish"" dismay) I happened upon these.
They are what I would consider a ""contour or pouch"" style thong and they are, hands down, the BEST OVERALL THONG I have ever worn! They have a cotton mesh pouch (sexy, but not really ""see-through"") that is the most comfortable ride my ""boys"" have ever had. 
I absolutley love them/live in them. 
The Brazilian T-back makes the support across the Netherlands all but unnoticeable while the stretchy sides provide frontal support and all-around comfort. 
Plus, check out the price! 
OMG! 
Anyone who's shopped for a name brand thong knows the average going price is between 15 and 25 dollars.
At 8 bucks, these thongs are unbeatable, and if you don't mind the color yellow you can own one for 5. Too good! 
I bought two of every color and am hoping they still make these when those wear out. 
It will be a sad day in the Underworld when these thongs become unavailable.
Attention atheltes; added bonus! These are comfortable enough to wear while running, jogging or working-out. 
The cotton pouch is softer than any jock I've ever encountered (while offering equal support) and the lack of those ""butt straps"" adds an easy 2-3 mph to my runs. 
Seriously (I'm sure it's physcological)! 
THESE THONGS ROCK. 
Plus, she thinks they are way sexy (bonus-bonus, nudge-nudge) as the pouch was designed and sewn by someone who knows something about the male anatomy and physiology (evoking ""Yeah, Baby, Yeah"" from the Mrs). 
Don't miss out on these - you'll be sorry"
1045,"I need a double sided slit slip that was short.  After going to several stores, it was just easier to order exactly what I wanted.  The quality and such are great."
1047,"These mules are one of the most comfortable shoes that I  have. I like Clark products, their workmanship is always outstanding.  This product really holds my foot, the leather is soft, and your foot is just cushioned on the soles.  It is excellent. Great Buy especially for us that have a shoe size that cannot be bought in a department store.."
1048,I ordered this jacket and trust me...I didn't expect for it to be as beautiful in person as I did online!!!  I ordered a medium and it fits perfect.  It's not meant to be worn in very very cold weather unless you like to layer because it's not a heavy coat but it you don't like heavy coats and don't care for layering then this is the jacket for you.  The fabric is amazing and the fur is almost as close as the real thing.  I highly recommend it...it's assume!!!  Oh...and who can beat a price like that!!
1049,"The Vintage Fatigue Cap, is a great looking, great fitting (true to size) item.  I was very happy when my cap arrived and saw that it looked better than I had imagined (even though the advertisement picture provided was an excellent reproduction).
   The cap came within the specified time and was packeged to arrive in excellent condition.  
   Once again, I am very happy with a product that I ordered through Amazon and its vendor"
1051,A great bargain!  Saved 50% over buying separately.  Good quality.  Very satified
1052,"These are the most comfortable panties I have ever owned in my life.  They fit right, don't ride up and look like new washing after washing.  I hope to never have to do without the Vanity Fair Microfiber panties again.  I would pay $10 a pair for these if I had to, they truly are awesome!!"
1054,"I bought my first pair of berks from QVC and I loved them. I wore them as many places as I could because of the comfort, and  I simply refused to change shoes.  The only thing with that is the shoe ran over quicker than I anticipated so I had to buy three more pair. The heel does not last as long as a walking or running shoe from esprit --- that is the only draw back.

Since the inside of the shoe molds to your feet, it will reflect your shoe size if you lose or gain too much weight.  When I lost weight after having my baby, I lost weight in my feet as well and I had to start wearing bulky soxs with my berks instead of stocking.

When I first tried on my berks, they were a little tight and slightly uncomfortable but after walking around in them for about two days it loosen up and molded to my feet, -----  once that happened they were very comfortable from then on.

Another thing I love about it my sister cannot borrow my berks because she says they don't fit her right and they are uncomfortable. We wear the same size shoe give or take a few minor width inches here and there, but because the berks are molded to my feet imprint and my walking pattern she can't wear them comfortable. Yes, Yes, I love that little feature."
1055,"Good value for the price! However, I should have ordered size 9 or possibly 8 . the size 10 med. is way too large. Couldn't afford to return for smaller size, wouldn't make sense to me since the price is so reasonable to begin with, return postage would have taken away the great value. j.iv"
1056,"Love them!!! I bought a pair for my niece for Christmas.  They are light, comfortable and surprisingly temperate.  My feet are never too cold or hot.  I now wear them everyday to work.  If it is raining outside then I wear a different pair to the building and put them on as soon as I am in my office"
1057,i bought this for my girl friend and she really loved it!!!! its very spacious...and has soft leather touch...a real buy and at awesome price!!
1059,"I've looked and looked for a wallet to hold all my credit cards, store discount cards, medical cards, business cards, etc.... and one that didn't end up four inches thick after I got everything in it, which made it hard to sit down. I bought one of these wallets and used it for a year and it works great. I went back and bought two more for when the original wears out so that I would have to hunt for another one. But so far the original is holding up great"
1060,"Three Cheers to Wrangler for coming our with jeans that are made to fit a real woman and not some male designer's idea of what our bodies should look like.  This is the most comfortable pair of jeans I have EVER worn.  Aura also has casual khaki pants, but they're not sold here."
1061,"I love tank tops (sleeveless shirts) and wear them pretty much all the time outside work. I have worn dozens of different brands of tank tops, including brands from popular sellers such as Banana Republic, but this tank top is is the best and in a league of its own. At just over $10, it is a bargain. It is so comfortable to wear. It has a great style that blends in with the body. I have no words to describe how much I love this tank top. So much that I have already bought one dozen of this tank top to stock up for future, fearing that it may run out of stock. The only downside is that it only comes in a few colors. Andrew Christian, please make this tank top available in all possible colors. I would be the first one to place order for aother dozen if you can provide more colors. Please make this tank top available in Size S also."
1062,"I really like these particular bedroom slippers because they cover your entire foot. My feet stay cold year-round, so I wear bedroom slippers all the time. The slippers are very soft, nice to walk around the house in and I plan to buy more like these. I recommend them to anyone who wants a comfortable shoe at a good price"
1063,"Bought this for my son, he had been looking for a ""jogging suit"" like they had in the '80's and this was the '07 version"
1064,"I love this panty! It's so comfortable. The material is very silky and feels great on the skin, but it also have a lot of stretch which makes if fit very well. This was the first No Panty Line Promise panty I got, but after getting this I also went and got one of the thongs, which is also wonderful. I think this is one of the most comfortable panties I've ever worn. I want a lot more"
1065,"These are wonderful pants and for a good price too. My baby is wearing the 6-9 size and she is about 16 lbs and 26 inches at six months. The length is very good. I think she'll be in these at least another month or so. The material isn't cheap or light and they don't stretch out easily. The color of these match the colors in most baby clothing out there presently - which is very nice! I've bought a bunch of things from Baby Because through Amazon and some are really poor quality and others, like these, are wonderful, so don't judge them on their prices, some of their things are really nice. These pants are at least as good as the more expensive ones. I recommmend them"
1066,"As manufacturers continue to shed unprofitable lines and present ""one size fits all,""it becomes increasingly difficult
for those of us who wear narrow sizes to find shoes that fit in
anything other than the most expensive brands. These shoes
are well made and an excellent value. The only negative
is that are made from a wider last and have an internal spacer
to make them narrow. The heel tends to wallow a little bit in
my particular case"
1067,I bought this for my Grandson and he loves it. It saves his mom from picking up towels all over the house after his shower
1068,"Nice top, Construction is ok at best. Great for knocking about without looking too casual"
1069,"I love the detroit tigers, this is a good buy for any baseball fan. its cheaper here then in stores"
1071,"I received this today, a day earlier than the first day of the estimated delivery. I already tried it on and it fits perfect. It is definitely the quality I would expect from Leg Avenue. It is soft to touch, beautifully made and the perfect fit. I know my husband will be pleased"
1073,"These boots are great! The seller is equally as wonderful as the merchandise!. These were a gift for my daughter and I got the wrong size. Communication,exchange process as quick and smooth as if I went to the store myself.  The correct size arrived and my daughter was DANCING AROUND THE HOUSE in her new boots.She LOVES them!! I would definately recommend this sellers store to anyone, and I have"
1074,"I bought this item for my mp3. Its perfect for protection, so you dont have to worry on damaging your mp3. The screen protector adds safety to the screen. I use the strap for exercising, its does its job. The clip is perfect if you dont want to carry your player in your pocket and hand all the time"
1076,"This Jock is awesome.  It's obviously a ""swim"" style jock with a narrow 1 1/4 inch waistband and standard leg straps.  The woven Jock pouch is soft, comfortable and holds everything great.  The best thing about this jock is that it feels like you're not wearing anything at all, it's very lightweight.  I ordered the Medium size and it didn't bind, twist, pinch or squeeze.  I like it so much I ordered two"
1078,"These shoes are very, very comfortable.  The price was reasonable; delivery timely.  All in all, quite a satisfactory purchase"
1079,"These are great for beginners.  Yes, they are irregular and some make more noise than others, but for beginners and for practicing they are great.  It is a good purchase for the price.  If you do not mind the irregularities, you will be happy with these scarves"
1080,This is an excellent product. It gives great tummy control and there are no visible lines showing through your outer wear.  I have been wearing this style for years.  The material is very durable  - I have had some last for years and still look new
1081,"The product is good. It makes the leg look elegant.

Amazing Price for a quality product"
1082,"These are comfortable, durable, attactive shoes at a good price.  Just right for the office.  I'm glad I made the right choice"
1083,"This bag meets all of my needs that I purchased it for; as a day tripper with my child. I purchased this bag to use to carry diapers, an epi-pen, wallet, hand sanitizer, etc in it and all of it fits plus more. This is one of the best purchases I have made in a really long time"
1084,"Overall I'm happy with the skin. It fits the Treo 700 very closely. This was custom formed for every curve, bump, and button on the Treo. My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p. I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it. The 700w and p, if you don't know, are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. The button layout is the same, but they different icons and purposes. Well, the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w, not the 700p. Not a huge deal, just a slight annoyance. I'm going to see if there's a way to remove these somehow"
1085,I have 2 pairs of this model shoe and love them.  After being a Nike fan for years I decided to give something else a try.  This shoe is lightweight and very comfortable.  I also love the classic style.  And you can't complain about the nice price
1086,These are same shoes Men's Warehouse sells for $100. They fit very well and are very comfortable. I definitely would buy again
1087,"This product is fine, however it was much too baggy.  I'm not that skinny and I felt like the excess leg space made me look ridiculous.  There is nothing wrong with the short, but I just wish I had bought a smaller size.  Definitely go with the smaller size if you buy this product."
1088,"I ordered 5 of these dresses for my bridesmaids. Two of them were too big for the girls so I sent them in for smaller sizes. Not only was the exchange free, but the new dresses arrived within a couple of days! Now, all of my bridesmaids have dresses that fit perfectly and look beautiful! I would definitely order from GoJane again"
1089,"i have been a fan of this style since i was little and swam competitively. if you do not have a traditional petite body, this swimsuit is great! it has coverage in all the awkward areas that some of the other designs don't. i am 5'9 and well, not ""skinny"" and i was happy with the way it fit. if you are unsure of your size however, unless you are racing, it is best to order one size up. i went with a size up from what i wear in men's jeans and it seemed to work"
1090,"The Hi Strung shoes are the most comfortable dress shoes I have EVER purchased. They feel like slippers! The leather is really soft, just like gloves....as the description says. I'm a medium width and they fit just right. I wouldn't recommend them for someone with a wide foot because the leather is just right...no extra room for a wide foot."
1091,"These boots are warm, comfy and a great deal.  The only thing missing is the ""ugg"" label, so if you're into quality and not brand these are the boots for you"
1092,its what i needed for all my cards ! you cant go wrong with this product . and the price was perfect .
1093,The collar stays work well and the shipping was on par. I will consider ordering from this company again
1094,received socks very fast and just what I ordered they are very warm and heavy work great in the cold. I bought 2pr and glad I di
1095,"The only reason that they are not 5 stars is that the zipper is cheap.  A heavier duty zipper the easily slides would make these pants perfect.  Everything else about these pants are well made and comfortable, a good buy"
1096,"My daughter loved it, she uses it everydyay. Thank God, it's quick dry.."
1097,It is a must have for all monty python and the holy grail fans!
1098,"Wasn't sure about the material these were made of, but they seem to hold up very well. Less fraying or seam tearing than silk but the same texture, maybe just a bit thicker. Less of a static problem than silk. Fit is average/typical or possibly a little on the larger than sized size"
1099,"Lovely trousers; but, on the third order that I made, through Amazon, the price was quoted as 47.70/pair, which I thought was a pre-Father's Day sale price; but Jos. A Bank added an extra charge for the trousers to reflect the price of 59.90/pair which I had paid previous to what I assumed was a reduction.  That seems a bit misleading to me, either on the part of Amazon or Jos. A Bank.  Would be nice if one or the other would be completely accurate in their price quotation.  Otherwise, I have no complaint about the products' looks or quality"
1100,This is a great little pack for kids to carry their own camera and money in when you go to a theme park.  The waist fits even slim kids
1101,"I purchasese the red ones, and I love them. They really go well with many different colors. I was really pleasantly surprised"
1102,"With a good selection of colors to go with the casual style, to say I love these shoes is an understatement. They are very comfortable, and have grown on me so much, they are about the only casual style shoes I have bought in the past few years"
1103,"I will buy one at this time. Please put the shoes in a small box because when they put on in a big packing that is very expensive for my.  You complete measures of security for the articles but sometimes oneself articulates it is wrapped up different (in small or very big packings)    
  
I thank if it is possible to put it in a single very small box so that I pay less for the shipment (I transfer to my country) because there are very big differences of money.     
      
thank you      
      
MORAIMA MENDOZA"
1104,Very noisy and beautiful - and has not fallen apart after 1 dance/day minimum
1105,"I love this bra. It is so comfortable and I never find myself having to ""adjust"" it like other bras. It stays in place and after a while I forget I have it on. I will say that it is not really very flattering, but hey its a sleep bra. I wear it around the house and it is just great."
1106,"i am picky about the kind of sock i put on me & my son's feet. his feet have been sized as extra wide (!!) and these socks fit wonderfully, in his size, without being stretched tight. i love the high cotton content & the cushioned soles. these are well made socks & i will be buying from this brand when it's time for the next size up"
1107,These are so lovely and comfortable iam going to buy me another pair of these
1108,I purchased this shirt for my husband.  He is thrilled.  Good quality garment.  Washed well.
1109,"I wore this for a 50th birthday party for a Pirate theme.  Everyone loved it, and more so I loved how it looked and felt.  This is a great corset"
1110,"this a totally awesome fitting bra, even better for the fuller figure.

I am a 36 DD, love this bra, no poking and digging of the unerwires.

Great everyday bra.  This and CHAMPION  every day sport bra, these are my all time favorites.

My body has changed a bit, I think all women change through the years, so it's really imortant to try different styles of bras, for me this one and CHAMPION  work the best. 

Bali bras have always been my very favorite anyway.

I am not sure I think Bali makes the CHAMPION BRA

Thank"
1111,"Recently, I took a motorcycle trip from Atlanta, GA to Ft. Lauderdale, FL. Unfortunately, I didn't have the option of riding at night when it was cooler and with my thermometer on the bike showing between 100 and 110, it felt like riding through an oven with a hair dryer set on high blowing in my face. I also didn't have the luxury of air conditioning so to simulate this so I would pour water on my t-shirt and let the wind cool it down. 

After getting home, I recalled seeing a demonstration of a cooling vest that you soaked in water for a couple of minutes then wore under a jacket, preferrably mesh. I was amazed at how well it worked in the demo so I went online and ordered one.

The particular model I ordered from Amazon is the Deluxe Evaporative Cooling Vest in black. It came about a week after I ordered it via USPS Priority Mail. They offer several styles and colors, including some that have removable sleeves

The outer shell is quilted black nylon with 2 outside, zippered pockets and a zipper up the front. The neck has a velcro closure so it can fit snuggly around your neck if you want. The inner liner is blue and is 100% Nylon Taslan, a water repellant fabric, so it keeps you from getting all wet wearing it. Out of the package, it weighs just a few ounces but when you put it in water, the special material, called Polymer Embedded Fabric (PEF), between the inner and outer shells absorbs water and the vest ends up weighing about 2-3 lbs. You only need to soak it for about a minute. There are spandex panels on either side that allow for some for expansion. I got the Large size and it fits great, not too tight, not too loose. 

Once the water is absorbed, the instructions (on the tag in the vest) say you can wring it out or use a towel to blot the inner liner dry. Not being like a sponge, wringing it doesn't do a lot of good so I'd suggest blotting if you need to. While the inner liner is water repellant, there might be some water on it right after you soak it so putting it on might get you a little wet but if you don't soak it too long, the inner liner will be relatively dry. The material that holds the water doesn't expand like a sponge, it just holds lots of water...it's pretty interesting stuff.

The first thing you'll notice after a few seconds is that it's cool to the touch. The principle of it relies on the cooling properties of water as it evaporates and it really works. I haven't had a chance to ride with it in sweltering heat yet, but putting it on under my mesh jacket and riding without a windshield kept me nice and cool. I don't think I'd like to try it in anything less than about 65 deg (F) because I'd probably freeze nor would I want to use it under a leather jacket unless there was some way for the jacket to let wind flow through it. The inner liner stays pretty dry but you might get a little damp. The cooling effect will last several hours depending on how long you soak it and if you want to put things in the front pockets, they are lined with the same material as the inner liner so they'll stay relatively dry. One thing I've found though, it'll take several days to completely dry out unless you ride with it. The water is very slow to evaporate but once it does, the weight goes back down to a few ounces.

Bottom line, I HIGHLY recommend getting one of these if you routinely ride in hot weather. They're an inexpensive way to keep cool and they're stylish (except for the hi-vis lime green). Wear it under a mesh jacket and you won't know it's hot outside."
1112,My girl is very happy of your product. Thank you for giving us excelent products. Regard
1113,Arrived in an evelope on time. The Darh Vadar character looks a little bit off in its representation. The medium is big for a medium.
1114,"I had the same problem about it not really being true to size. I'm small, 5'0 and about 100lbs, but when I put the small on, it was tight. I don't have much weight to lose, so I guess I'll be spending more time in the gym toneing up.

I've gotten lots of compliments on it though"
1116,"Good quality socks.  Wear well, wash well, are comfortable to wear.  Would recommend Wigwam products"
1117,"My girlfriend thinks they're sexy and they're solid underwear.  No swampiness from boxers or boxer briefs.  If you're a briefs guys (I switch around), these are the way to go"
1118,Thin - but great gloves.  You can use your car keys with these on
1119,"This dress is a BARGAIN. I'm chaperoning prom this year, and this is perfect!  Who would have thought one could get such a lovely dress for such a low price.  It is pure ELEGANCE."
1120,I got this robe for my wife for Christmas and she LOVES it. All of her girlfriends are super jealous and have been asking where I got it and telling their husbands they need to get them one. She says it is very comfortable and warm. It's long enough to curl up in and just hang out and enjoy the day. Very nice quality and comes nicely packaged
1121,"All Aerosoles have that extra aaaahhh when you wear them, and these are no different.  I've worn them with skirts, slacks and jeans, my daughter (teen) liked them so much that she bought herself a pair.  I liked my black pair so much that I bought them in brown also"
1122,"I've been wearing these Waterproof Rockports for years but this is the first pair I ordered (directly) from Amazon.

They are terrific everyday shoes.  Very comfortable and very practical (waterproof).  They now come with Vibram soles, I believe for the first time.

The price from Amazon is significantly less than what I have paid at local discount retail outlets in the past"
1123,"Great price, great style, easy on/off for parents!!  Fast shipper too!!  Just great sneaks - tough too!"
1124,Great Quality Shirt and no itchy tag...very quick shipping from seller.  I love the nice selection of colors and the shirt is not too tight and not too lose.  Has a cool Champion logo
1126,"This boot looks good and is very comfortable to wear; my only caveat is that it easily scuffs, especially on the toe.   And you often have to apply shoe polish.  But other than that, it's a terrific shoe"
1128,Wear them daily on the job and on commutes. Saves time using Velcro instead of laces. I did some running in them but they are really better for walking instead. After two months of wear the sole is still in one piece and the stitches are still in place. The interior sole lining smells bad after 2 days wear due to the material they NB makes it with. I had to changed them out and put better ones in.  This was the only minor problem I had with them. On top of that the availablity of extra wide sizes means no blisters or corns!!
1130,"I purchased these for my 12 year old daughter. They are beutiful and she loves them. She wears them as shoes outside. At first I was so worried about them getting ruined and dirty, but they are very hardy and wipe clean very easily. We are both very happy with the purchase"
1132,I gave these booties as a Christmas gift to my sister.  She loved them.  We both really like the chinchilla lining; it's so soft and warm.  I would recommend this product to others.  I have given other styles of Acorn slippers to friends and family.  I also have a pair of Acorn slippers.  I love them
1133,"These are the cutest little baby socks that look like shoes I have ever seen.  The packaging is great, the colors are great and I can hardly wait to gift them to my new grandson :-"
1134,"I bought this tank in red & the color of the fabric is wonderfully vibrant.  The quality of the fabric is so nice that I wore the top to dinner with a printed skirt & received several compliments on the outfit.  Caution! This style runs about 1 size small.  Athletica offers excellent, personalized customer service and every one of the 10 tank tops I ordered were of a quality for which some brands cost as much as $38."
1135,"These glasses fit great and with the spring hinges on the side it makes you feel better to know they won't snap like some other glasses, not to mention they look great"
1136,I'm an Old Corp Marine and need a pair of jungle boots to replace my old ones. The new boots they have in the military didn't suit me and was happy to see these boots at a really good rate. I couldn't find one my size and order them through Amazon. They arrived by UPS and after breaking them in they work just fine.
1137,"I really did not believe that this item would work. I lit ""three on a match and ordered three to prove it. I still can't believe just how well it worked just perfectly as promised. Where has this product been all my life! I just happened to ""stumble"" over it looking for ties. Thanks for
your great product placement. I can promise anyone reading this one thing:
YOU WILL NOT FIND A BETTER VALUE FOR YOUR MONEY ANYWHERE on the internet"
1138,I ordered three of these types of items. They were all fairly good but this was the best. I use it everyday
1139,The socks were a gift for a friend. They really enjoy the comfort and cozy feeling of the plush socks. They are a great buy
1140,"I am happy with this choice. it matches my green mini so well. i do have to say that the cut out for the wheel is a little off, but everything works just fine. i like the cute cut out for the headphones. it also closes with magnets at the bottom. which is nice, you can access it very easily."
1141,"This sandal is beautiful, gold with gemstones, and easy to wear.  Kenneth Cole never disappoints and this sandal is a rare bargain.  I got a size 8 and my feet have plenty of room.  It is wide enough as well.  This color makes every outfit look special.  I think the price is 50% off the original.  This may be the shoe of the summer!"
1142,"The EasyGo Travel Pillow with Pouch (Black) is functional, comfortable, and had timely shipping. It also makes a nice travel gift."
1143,"Good color visibility; nicely structured with warmth applicable to the unspeakable and inhuman frigidites of the amerikan North.
The hat fits snugly and will evoke a positive commentary now and again. 
I have ordered Maroon but will likely add some other color choice, as the array is rather impressive. For an 100 % acrylic knit, this is not a bad hat; the only problem perhaps being that it sucks up hairs very easily, almost as if it were a hair-vacuum machine."
1144,"I am a 40D and it is very difficult to find a bra that lifts, is comfortable and the straps will stay on all day. My search is over. This bra stayed on my shoulders all day!!! This has never happened to me before. Wonderful product, seamless and comfortable. Please don't hesitate to buy"
1145,"My son got the honor of playing ring bearer at a friend's wedding, but the problem of finding a tux to fit an 18 month old was difficult. Everywhere we looked, the price was actually going to be *more* than renting an adult tux! 

As much as I try to help the local economy, I hate to say, I was delighted to find a tux online for nearly half the price as the local stores. The suit fit my son nearly perfectly, and was very easily adjusted in places that were slightly too large (my son has little to no bottom, so all of his pants will eventually fall off if I don't clothes pin them in back... that was nothing new).

In addition to this being adorable, it's COMPLETE. Even the comberbun. Needless to say, he, and the suit were a hit. 

I am very, very happy with this purchase"
1149,"The Luxury Spa Robe with the Cotton Terry Lining is the BEST robe that you can find.  We have gotten so may other robes, but this is the one!  My husband and I each have one and it feels like we are in the spa every day!  You can't go wrong with it and it's worth every dollar!  And it's the greatest gift to give!"
1150,the item Nike B2.9 Gymsack  arrived in foreseen time and it is the great usefulness for my because it is comfortable
1151,"This men's raincoat is an outstanding bargain. It features classic styling, is very well made and is being offered at a reasonable price. Without doubt, I consider this a terrific purchase."
1152,This is the best Jock Strap I have ever had.  The waist strap was not too large or small and the pouch was made of extremely supportive and comfortable materials
1154,"Shoes arrived very quickly and I am estatic with the price, paid one quarter of the amount other places and catalogue's were asking.  This was truly a GREAT deal.  I got 2 pair of lovely shoes for almost half the price on 1 pair"
1155,"Like wearing a moccasin only with more support. More supple than most Driving Shoes, and light weight too. Soles wear very well, as do uppers. A Great looking shoe that has become my favorite knocking around shoe, yet plenty dressy for evenings eating out in Southern Cal"
1158,"I wanted a simple, plain, handsome tie clip. It's easy to place and 
grips just well enough to hold your tie in place in face of errant 
tugs and pulls as well as in high winds but it doesn't clamp so 
tight to mark or ruin one's more delicate ties made of materials 
like silk, etc. 

The silver and gold clips are both basic and normal tones that 
you would want to go with everything of the like. Look them up. 
Great for the price and people can't tell what you paid for the 
clip--as they retain their shine. Worth the price ten fold"
1159,"If you have every pair of dickies ever made, this is the product for you. No one around will have these.  It's an excelent way to express alittle of yourself when you already have expressing yourself down pat.  They also came in a very timely manner.  I was very inpressed.  They look way better in person"
1160,"GREAT...it's little bit heavy but a got used to it. appearance is great, and as KG says ""It rock with jeans""...first two days a had had blisters but after one week it's like being in heaven"
1161,"This is a wonderfully made garment.  People thought I paid big bucks for it. It looks like real leather and the construction is great.  This was my second time purchasing this costume.  My son out grew the first one in the child size and it still looks like new.  He wanted to be Neo for another costume party and begged me to buy another so -I got the adult small, which was a little big for him.  I wish I would have gotten the teen size. Even so - Its was a great purchase and he will grow into it"
1162,"I love Birkenstock and at this price, I just couldn't let it pass!  They are so comfortable.  I'm wearing them right now!"
1163,"it means so much to me to be able to buy a pair of jeans that fit me in length.  ya who.
Am"
1165,"Beatifull, Nice, Fancy!! This is a very good quality item. The only thing I would say about it, is that it has little details is the leather strap. I had to apply some glue on it, but its perfectly now"
1166,Great looking pair of shoes.The elastic on the big toe is a little too tight.May be after some time of ware it will be better
1167,"Great leggings....I love the feel of these....thicker than the regular cotton/lycra leggings and they hold you in nicely.....One thing I like about Danskin is the waist elastic is not tight, it just rests on your waist. It's extremely comfortable. Gusseted cotton crotch is also a plus...I wear these to yoga, pilates, on hikes with my dog and just about everywhere else. Oh, and they look much more expensive than the cotton leggings......I even wear them in 90 degree weather. I just can't get enough of them......I have always appreciated Danskin quality, just machine wash and dry and off you go...."
1168,"These are great shorts to work, play, or live in.  Like all Carhartt jeans and dungarees, they're very comfortable to wear without underwear on those hot days (or any day).

They tend to be sized a bit big.  I normally wear a 38x36, but with Carhartt dungarees I wear a 36x34.

Well worth the money"
1169,"Order arrived quickly, and though I haven't worn them yet, they appear to be a good bargain"
1170,"Forget for a second that these panties are crotchless and let's focus on how they look. They look great, dynamite on the eyes, front, back and sideways. Just absolutely georgous. Every bit as good looking as the Tango Tanga panties, also by Love Fifi that I think really look good. Boy I have to admit when it comes to lady's undies, these Love Fifi people really know their stuff"
1172,"Pros:
Ultra Fast delivery w/package tracking. Item was shipped within a few hours of order. Suit is in great condition and I like the color.
Cons:
When they say grab bag...that means the suit may or may not look like the picture. Mine turned out to be a blue stripped jammer...which is cool with me cause I actually wanted a blue jammer. Just be prepared"
1173,"This is definitely a tomboy bag; with lots of buckles, straps, and a strategically placed pocket to carry your cell-phone/Blackberry or PDA.  The main compartment can fit all the daily essentials and then some, and its also got a long shoulder strap that you can sling across your chest.

The only downfall is that there are no studs on the bottom of the bag, and if the bag is handled roughly over a long period of time, there is the chance that the bottom will be damaged, stained, or torn (that's why I took of 1 star).

If you like sports and are inspired by athletic design in luxury handbags, Prada's sports line is the winner, and this bag embodies feminine athleticism, superb design, and every-day practicality."
1174,"This shawl is soft, cozy, warm...a perfect wrap for the winter. I'm getting one for all my friends this Christmas-it couldn't be better priced."
1175,"I purchased this shoe at a retail store, before just now finding it on Amazon, for less (of course). Buy this shoe!! It is the most perfect shoe. It has the graceful look of a ballet slipper, the comfort of walking barefoot, and the active sole of a tennis shoe. The velcro makes it easy on and off, so it is great for the active mom. I wish I could get it in every color, but the pink is just too fun. And, it actually looks good with whatever color I'm wearing - it's just that cute of a shoe! Enjoy"
1176,"This is one great bra - I have two of them I've thrown into the washing machine more times than I can count over the course of several years, and it wears and wears and wears. I would think stretch lace means flimsy, but it isn't at all. This is one of the most comfortable bras I've ever found, and I've tried many of them.  If you want a bra that will hold everything up AND hold up well to multiple washing, and still look feminine, this is it"
1179,This is a great pair of underwear.  It is very soft against your skin.  It doesn't feel like most thongs and ride up on you or give you a major wedgie.  They are comfortable enough to be worn all day.  There is enough waist to these that it won't be obvious that you are wearing a thong if your pants droop.  Enjoy the minimal back coverage that is provided while maintaining the comfort of this underwear as it holds you nicely in place
1182,"They're great! They're soft and are of perfect comfort to my feet.  They are QUIET when you walk - no sqeaking, or other annoying noises.  I entend to purchase a couple more pairs in the suede.  And they look cool!"
1183,"I bought these shoes because I typically find Aerosoles to make a comfortable and stylish shoe. However, the area directly under the buckle seems very tight, and there is stitching that rubs against the top of my foot. It's still a comfortable shoe, however, I have a desk job so I don't have to walk in them all day. I love the way these shoes look, however, I wish that I didn't have to deal with this annoyance"
1184,"I have a wide, relatively short foot with a high arch and have lots of problems finding high quality dress shoes that fit.  Bostonians are the only quality shoes that fit me, so I have been loyal for the last decade.  I can't find them in my area, so Amazon is the only channel I use to get them"
1185,Bealls really delivers with these navy pants-it's so hard finding elasticized cotton knit pants that look good-and these fit the bill
1186,"My hubby thinks these are super-comfortable and I think they look great. A good compromise between boxers and briefs. Pretty pricey, but worth the dough for comfort, style and durability"
1187,"I couldnt resist these shoes for the price...I've had good experience with Bandolino branded shoes.  I have two other pairs that are stylish and very comfortable.  Sure enough, this pair of boots are very comfortable too!  The color is a great burnished bronze, that is a great neutral color to wear (plus metallics are in fashion again).  The zip-up is easy, and the calf is roomy.  I'm very happy with them, and would recommend them to anyone who doesn't want to spend 100's of dollars, but wants to get the look and comfort of expensive shoes"
1188,bought as a gift for my son.  i was thought it had a very nice scent.  my son seems to be pleased with it also
1189,"The backpack is sturdy & has enough room for all the high school textbooks, which is hard to find"
1190,"I got these simply because they were on sale and I needed a new pair of casual kicks. These are awesome! Comfortable, excellent quality, all around a good investment for the 35 dollars I paid"
1191,can't go wrong with this partner @ amazon.  top quality of product/delivery/service.  this company deserves your business!!!!
1193,I have these boots in the sand color and I love the. Many times I wish I had them in black. I searched everywhere trying to find these boots in black and was so excited to find them here on Amazon!  thanks
1194,"Now this Military Style Combat Boot is one of a kind! It takes a while to break it in but after, you will enjoy it! It looks so cool just looking at it, never mind wearing it! its leather is tops! And it WILL last a life time! Not water proof, but great for jungle trekking! Shines easy"
1195,"Just like any apple product it was easy to set up, cool to use, and has motivated me to loose weight. I'm up to 10 lbs. so far"
1196,"LOVE THESE SHADES!! THEY ARE GLAMOROUS AND MAKE U LOOK AND FEEL LIKE JACKIE O!! I WAS CONSTANTLY ON A SHADES HUNT, KNOWING SOMEWHERE THERE WAS THE PERFECT SHADES FOR ME, NOW I HAVE NO LONGER HAVE A NEED TO SEARCH. IT HAS ENDED! I'VE FOUND THEM! IT WAS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT. CAN'T WAIT FOR OTHER VERSIONS TO COME OUT"
1197,Keep warm & dry in wet weather with these unique boots that everyone will notice
1198,"The skirt arrived pretty rumpled, but after I ironed it the ""swirl"" part at the bottom looked pretty nice. With some boots and a sweater, it will make a comfortable, casual outfit for travel. I would have given it 5 stars, but the fabric is thinner than you would expect from cordoruy. However, it is stretchy and flattering and an amazing deal! I can always put on leggings under it!"
1199,"These things are GREAT. Any woman that wears pants should own at least 3 pairs of these. Super comfortable, non-bunching, They never peek out to say hello (unless you want them to :P). I wish my underwear drawer was full of just these. Plus they look sexy too :"
1200,I actually ordered these sleep pants as part of my oldest son's Halloween costume.  I was really pleased with them when they arrived.  My son liked them so much that he decided to sleep in them after Halloween.  He says they are very comfy
1201,These boots are cute and comfortable - very good for winter hiking in cold climates like New England
1202,"This pair of shorts are really cute and comfortable.  They are really short and the material is really soft.  The waist fits quite well and the leg holes are comfortable.  I purchased a size medium and I am a size 6 and they were perfect.

If you have thick legs, i would not recommend.  But if you have toned legs, they are great for revealing them"
1203,"I bought this scarf with a gift certificate I received for Christmas.  I love it so much and my kids love it so much they are buying their own.  It is super-warm and retains it shape, even after my nine year old tried it on as a dress"
1204,"I have 2 on order, because they didn't have my size, and I'm teling you that you hardly know that you're wearing it except that you suddenly feel secure without restricted. I have extremely sensitive skin this bra doesn't irritate it one little bit, it's simply fabulous"
1205,These are the only shoes I wear so I bough tthem for my daughter.  They are so comfortabl
1206,"I love this kit, it has everthing in it anyone could want the customer service from salonwear is fabulous
great products and great company
thank you salonwear so muc"
1207,I ordered the black first and then the wheat.  This identical jacket is over $100 at my local mall.  I ordered a small and it fits perfect.  You could dress this jacket up or down especially the black one.  It is well constructed - looks expensive and is a medium weight but not at all bulky.  A very classy jacket.  I am very happy with my purchase.
1208,"This is a good bra, for the price.  It's comfortable, well-made, and provides good support"
1209,great item ...looks smaller in the picture then in real life..perfect for laptop
1210,This bra is surprisingly good quality considering the low price. My only complaint is that when the clasps in the back are on the last ones (when it's clasped to stretch widest) the clasps rub against your back and are somewhat painful
1212,MY HUSBAND ALWAYS WEARS THESE SOCKS AND THEY NOT ONLY LAST A LONG TIME BUT THEY NEVER STRETCH OUT.HE SAYS THEY ARE COMFORTABLE ALL DAY. WHEN YOU SEE A GOOD SALE BUY THEM. THIS LAST TIME FROM AMAZON THEY WERE NOT ONLY ON SALE BUT WITH FREE SHIPPING AND NO TAX IT WAS SURELY THE RIGHT PRICE
1213,"I absolutely love this bra!  It is so comfortable, you hardly feel that you are wearing a bra at all, yet you are supported in all the right areas.  It has just enough stretch in it for those days when you a little fuller than others.  It's super soft and feels great against the skin.  This bra is also very durable.  I wasn't sure if I was going to continue nursing when I firsy had my baby.  This the only bra I had, and wore it every day.  As you can imagine, it had to be washed almost every day as well.  I did this for about 3 months, and the bra was still in excellent condition!  I finally bought more of these bras!"
1214,Prompt delivery. Excellent service. Shoes were exactly like they were described. Love the shoes!
1215,"Well, why not? You've got a very decent amount of colour choices, and you can pick between a brass and silver buckle. I picked the silver & black combination, when it shipped it was more then I expected; for the same exact thing at a local mall you would pay twice as much and that's not considering tax. The only difference between this one and other belts of similar design that I've seen is that they all seem to have logos, either engraved or cut out. I don't enjoy sporting I giant logo on my waist. I much rather get what I want AND pay less for it. 

The buckle is not a design that opens and closes, rather you slip the belt through the buckle and tighten it by sliding a metal bar foward. If you close it tightly enough, it will hold a LOT of weight, far more then the open/slip belt through/close buckle on belt design. I carry a bunch of things on mine, including a heavy multi-tool, a knive, a phone, several pouches filled with a various manner of junk, a tape measure, and occasionally heavy construction tools. Granted the belt wasn't meant for this kind of weight but...normally after a few minutes my old buckle would just pop open from the weight...no such problem here. 

It opens and closes without trouble and will fit a large waist easily. What more do you want from a belt?! =) 

Andrew Christian were speedy enough in shipping it; it came a few days after my Amazon order, which was 3-5 business days. Great deal"
1216,"This is a nice heavy weight t-shirt. It has the classic black zig-zag on front & back, which I wasn't sure about from the description.  The recipient loved this shirt"
1217,"Best design for travel documents, makes traveling much easier no fussing to access ID and air plane tickets... Love thi"
1218,"I am very impressed by this garment...it does work. It does take getting use to wearing it. I how recommend you dont go to small But if you want to look like your thinner alot thinner, it hold everything in"
1219,"very comfortable,stylish and durable,shipped very fast,great price, 100% satisfied I will be back to shop at Bealls."
1220,The product was as advertised and delivered on time
1221,"I Like the gloves, but agree, too many tags at the outside of them and I'll hope a little more quality in the color of the leather used in the side of the palm, it is black and at the borders looks like it was used blue"
1222,"I'm a pretty sexy girl and these so called panties are just about too sexy for me. Ooooweee do I feel hot when I have 'em on. Levi's, shorts, dress or trucker's overhauls, it makes no difference. The whole rest of the world might not know what you have on under there, but you'll know and that's enough to add a certain blush to your face, let me tell you. They made me feel ready for bed all day long"
1223,"These socks are awesome.  I LOVE how soft and cozy they are.  Yes, they 'shed' a bit, and the first time you wear them, you'll get little fuzzballs under your toes, but I have remedied this by washing them inside out first, then outside in (?!) and the problem is solved.  These wear extremely well.  One year after buying & wearing these socks, they are still in great condition and as soft as day one.  Gave them as gifts this Christmas with rave reviews.  I highly recommend these fabulous socks"
1224,"company was fair priced, delivered quickly, very courteous when i had a question, and the items were good quailty. have subsequently purchased from them and plan to agai"
1225,"These socks are warm, comfortable, durable and possibly most important of all, they won't fall down"
1226,"Love, love, love!!  I cannot get them of my son's feet!"
1228,Really like the short leg style and the low rise.  It's very comfortable and the fit is just O.K
1230,"These dress shirts are the best! Wrinkle-Free, Breathable, Durable Material, Plus lots of styles, sizes and color options. Compare side-by-side to other dress shirts and you'll see and feel the difference"
1231,"If you are new to the New Balance 99X line then you wont notice that these shoes are stiffer than the 991's. The 991's were the Cadillac of running shoes, your could wear them ALL day and suffer very little fatigue. The 992's have a stiffer sole and the overall quality of the shoe seems like it will last longer. The 991 had some cheaper plastic parts that liked to crack and fall off. 

991 pros; comfortable, the better running shoe, cheaper

992 pros; not quite as comfortable but still better than most, will last longer, looks more stylish

For those of you trying to choose between these and another brand, remember that these shoes are made in the USA and not by sweat shop workers in another country. They both hold up very well over the long run compared to other brands."
1232,"French cuffs aren't for everyone, but if you want a little formal style, this is a very nice shirt"
1234,After buying many of the Short Sleeve ones I finally went back for 3 of the Long Sleeves............These are the same material and a very good fit. Wash great and very happy with them. Would definitely buy more.
1235,These  are by far the most comfortable and versatile work pants I own.  I spend a great deal of time working outdoors and I have found that they hold up well to all sorts of abuse.
1236,"Due more to Harve Benard's questionable marketing ploys (cashmere, riiiight! and they had the lawsuit against them to prove it too!) than Amazon's product description, it seems that this jacket has been short shrifted and maligned :D

The jacket itself is actually very pretty. It's beautifully lined and the cute dome buttons are unique. The color (Java for me) was exactly as pictured. The cut is excellent and very flattering to a fuller figure. The shoulder pads (not detachable) are somewhat annoying full, but nowhere near making anyone look like a football player.

For $24.99, this jacket is definitely worth it -- you would be hard pressed to find a jacket of good quality (cashmere claim not withstanding) for this price anywhere -- at least not one that looks more expensive than $24.99! I would not pay $178 (MSRP) for it, but at the current price, I just might go back and buy another one.

As for Amazon, I cannot sing enough praises about their excellent customer service! I have never had an issue that has not been resolved to my satisfaction"
1237,This was just like they said it would be and it came in faster then what they had told me it would.  I am very pleased with it
1238,I am pleased with the quality of the product. I was worried that I would receive my order is bad condition but I was wrong. I will be ordering again for the convinence and quality that I received
1239,"I love these shoes! Tsubo is notoriously comfortable and these are amazing! They aren't the prettiest shoes in the world, but I can spend 12 hours on my feet in them and my feet are happy"
1240,Good construction and material for the price.  Size seems a bit different in L vs. R unless I am more asymmetrical now than I noticed before?  Nice sheepskin material.  I am hoping this lasts longer than the previous moc I purchased by Acorn
1241,"This shoe is great. It even came with an extra pair of shoe strings that had a different design. The only thing that I felt it lacked was extra comfort. I wear Skechers and have done so for years and I have had other styles that were more comfortable although this was not top comfort it was definitely wearable and did not hurt my feet. 
It was a great deal that I just couldn't pass up and definitely worth the price :"
1242,I received these socks as a Christmas gift and they are the best socks I've ever owned!! They are very comfortable and don't get all bunched up in my shoes!! They kept their shape and size after being washed many times!! These socks are the best and I love them!! I just wish that they made them in more colors and fun patterns!!
1243,"The ""Jockey Elance"" bikini cut panties are comfy and well made, without giving up cute and sexy.They are cut just right with full coverage in back(yes there are those of us that still require this),a nice semi-high cut leg, and the waist band fits just low enough to wear with moderately low waist pants. They are 100% combed cotton, feel soft and nice, and even the elastic waist band is cotton covered for extra added comfort.
The 3-pack of black assorted I received contains 1 solid black pair and 2 pair that are a light green with a very pretty darker design of little flowers and box shapes.They still fit great even after laundering(the instructions say dry on medium but I used low).The price seemed just a little high but they are an excellent quality and have lasted through countless washings.

This style may also be found at ""Bare Necessities""  The prices at this time are exactly the same at the 3 sites. What I usually do is check for what the deals are on the shipping charges(this will depend on how much you are spending with each merchant in total) and also, you may find a different variety of colors or patterns at each. Just type in Jockey Elance 3 pack Bikini. This one is style 1449(check editorial description on product page to make sure), and just judging from the reviews of the other styles, these are the best in quality and comfort.

OOOOkay...so even though the world now knows what kind of underwear I wear, it's a product I thought worth a review.

You NEED these!....Happy Shopping......Laurie"
1244,socks stay up. not too thin and not too thick. comfortable. if you like above the calf you will like these. have not had long enough to see if they wear through easily or have loose stitching but so far so good
1245,Perfect little slippers to wear around the house and you can just throw them in the wash to clean them!
1246,The shoes fit good.  I ordered 1/2 size larger and he needs to break them in.  Nice looking shoes and I would recommend them to anyone. He has wore them 3 times and he says they feel better.
1247,"Great jeans overall.  They really help keep you warm.  However, order them the next size up from what you need.  My pair shrunk in the wash ( luckily I had ordered them one size up )"
1248,Hi im 13 and just started puberty. I was a boxer guy till my friend told me about these. He also wore boxers because kids said  gay kids only wear briefs so he wore them under his boxers. So one night when I sleep over at his place we went to his room and he took off his pants and boxers and left his briefs on. I asked why he wore those and he said they hide erections and are great when you just started puberty. He gave me a pair to wear to bed and to keep. I still wear them and they help me in puberty
1249,"I love these boots.They are comfortable, warm, and the color goes with everything. I got Mink. It's a peachy rose. I would highly recomend these boots"
1250,"this is a nice hat for women looking for short brims instead of the longer mens brims on most hats.. I own 2 of these and wear them everyday, to keep my hair in control due  to my Jeep window being down, while I deliver mail. Good fit"
1251,"Just to look the bottle, you'd think "" So? Whats the difference from all the other designer colognes?""

The difference is that little something that makes the members of the opposite sex physically stop and turn to see who's wearing that spicy fruity aroma.

Think Cool Water but dreamier, then imagine being able to wear it anytime of the day or night. Imagine being the subject of an investigation in a shopping que as to who's wearing that smell and having women sniff your neck and compliment you on how nice you smell.
Jackpot Baby, you just stood out from the crowd in one easy step."
1252,"This top is so comfortable and fits very nicely.  It is light weight, and can be used for a casual or more dressy occasion.  I highly recommend it. I got the light pink top, then ordered the black one later."
1253,"The moccasins are very well made, and actually run a bit big. My son wears a mens 14, and was concerned that they might be small. They would be fine even wearing thick socks. I recommend them highly"
1254,My son just loves his new Heelys! He could keep them to go to bed if I would let him !
1255,"This boot is nice and sturdy, goes great with a nice pair of jeans or a long skirt. I love wedges.."
1257,"I bought this top for my 18 year old son---thought it looked comfortable to wear under shirts etc. It is.  He likes wearing it, but he says he would never wear it alone.  It is a wee bit too 'feminine' to wear on top. Would I buy another one?  I don't know.  I think for him, the basic cotton tank tops are more versatile."
1261,"I love this skirt.
I wear it with my ""Live a Little"" denim jacket, so cute.
I find it to be really figure flattering.
I ordered a size 6 and it fit perfect.
Nice to find a denim skirt that's a little different than the other zillions out there"
1262,"I like them!  They're perfect for summer, or any time you don't need really warm socks"
1263,"Very soft... nice look and feel, however, is kinda small... my checks don't fit in"
1264,"I am a regular fitness swimmer and go through the lycra suits every 4-6 months.  They always get too stretched out and cause drag in the water.  This suit is holding up beautifully with none of the usual snags and wear marks from getting in and out of the pool.  Also, I'm usually a size 16, on the chunky side, but this suit looks good on me and fits well even in a size 14.  Really glad I found it"
1265,"I bought this product because the description read ""12 Pack"", but I actually received a 2 pack"
1266,"These are good quality baby bodysuits, and very reasonably priced.  Make sure you buy the size according to your baby's weight and height and not by the age posted.  My 3 month old girl is wearing the 6-9 month size. They are a little big, but thats great because they will last longer. Warning: the medium green body suit is not color fast, and will end up looking like ""camo"" wear after you wash it.  The other body suits in the green pack are color fast and will not fade quickly.  It seems it is just the one green bodysuit that doesn't hold up well.  I did not have any fading in the pink bodysuits.  All in all I'd recommend these"
1267,"I first purchased this bra in a specialty bra boutique for 139.00CA. I know it's a lot for a bra, but I was too happy that I found a bra that fit great. Up until that day I wore a 36D or 36DD, after getting fitted I am now a 32 G. You have to understand that I hate shopping for bras, I never found the right one and always walk out of the store thinking that I should get a breast reduction. 
This bra is the one that Oprah wears and loves. Now it is my favourite thing. 
I have to agree with the other customers that it is not the prettiest bra if you are a bigger chested gal like my self, but you forget about that when you put a t-shirt or blouse on, because you really do look 10 pounds thinner around the waist and you chest is where it should be. 
If you are a bigger chested gal, I would suggest before buying this bra, if you are not too sure what size you are, go and get fitted at a proper store....a specialty store. Most stores only sell bras in the A-DD cup, that is why you should go to a specialty store, the sales women know a lot more"
1268,"Overall they good and served their purpose as a men's lingerie item.  The wife enjoyed them!  She liked the look and feel.  If I were to order them again or recomend them I would definately order 1 size LARGER.  I have similar items that are great and have a snug fit, but these are just to tight and even wearing them for just a short time was not very comfortable. To really enjoy wearing them for any real lenght of time get one size up. And yes I of course realize they are not for everyday wear and am not comparing them to that. Other than that they're great"
1269,Everyone loves this scarf. Is big enough for the winter and is pretty comfortable
1270,"Girls - this is a great lingerie set!  The feel and fit are supurb; the panties are almost like second skin.  Very true fit.  Very sexy, too.  Highly recommended to please you and your partner"
1271,"Be forewarned that these run small and are not for the faint of heart.  But, if you have the assets to show off and enjoy that, these shorts will be right up your alley.  Comfortable with a good build quality, so they make a good value."
1272,"This item was shipped quickly and on time.  It stands out, not the same-old, same-old zip-up hoodie.  Would recommend this seller and item-(to any yankee fan).  Thanks for reading.  ="
1273,"Unlike other stores that charge huge premiums for shipping, this store keeps costs down by shipping in an envelope, which I appreciated.  Fabric felt lovely and luxurious, a quick steam and I was ready to party!  Highly recommend one of these wraps for any formal event"
1274,"These shoes are exactly what I have been looking for, although, as usual, I waited until the stores no longer carried them in stock.  My only regret is that I could not find them available the brown in my size, but the bronze will do very nicely.
The service and price were excellent"
1275,"Great nursing PJ's, the fabric was so soft and great quality! I love the"
1277,"Sizing was a little off, making the bra a little tight.  I feel it will relax and fit perfectly after a few wearings"
1278,"I like these shoes very much, i have bought over 12 pairs of shoes from amazon, and these rank in my top 3 pairs. Very white, very easy to keep clean. I have wide feet, and these are not tight at all"
1279,It was exactly what I wanted/needed.  Very satisfied with the product
1281,I can see why this is an award winning costume.  The price was cheap compared to stores and taking into account what you get.  It came with everything necessary for our son to dress up like a cop for Halloween except a toy gun.  It's a great value and I'd highly recommend it.  Our 8 year old son wore it almost every day for several weeks including about 5 different Halloween events and it held up well with no signs of wear
1283,My 62 year old father loves these pants. They require really no care-except for washing and take forever to wear out! He wears them everyday even though he would look younger & hipper if he wore a more up to date pair of pants. Thanks
1285,"This item makes you feel sexy, even if you are shy and/or not feel so confortable with your body. It make you feel dress and undress at the same time. 
I love it because I dont need to take it off at all, avoiding the sensation of been naked. With this you can enjoy been with your partner having amazing s..x."
1286,It is very confortable and looks great. I recently weent to New York and used it all around.IT was very confortable and fashonable :)
1287,"Very happy with these, they're very comfortable - and TWO colors each. Pleased with transaction"
1288,"My order was fast,did not have the color i want, the service was so great, i do like the bra alot, just wish it had the wide stra"
1289,"I sent this onesie to a friend of mine in San Francisco.  He had previously lived in Boston, and this was a gift for his new baby.  The parents were both pleased and the child looked good!  What more could you ask for in baby clothes"
1290,Excelent socks.  Feel like a foot massage!  Only thing...after two washes there was a small hole by my big toe.  I sewed it up and expect it will stay
1291,I am very pleased with my ordering experience. It came very quickly and was exactly how it was pictured.
1292,"Let me tell you, i purchase alot of underwear and these right now are one of my favorites. They are so comfortable and i love the material. I will be purchasing more in the future for sure"
1293,"The warmest, most  lasting, and  most  comfortable men's sock  on  the  market!  Excellant  Price $$"
1294,"Great Jacket!!! It has all I wanted, a lot of pockets, a fleece sweater that can be separated.  I loved it"
1295,"i was a little worried when i got these, because they ARE fisherman boots, and i wanted to use them as just simple rainboots.  but they're really awesome, and for only $20 very, very durable!  i'm glad i got them"
1296,"Slippers are comfortable, but tend to run a little small. Nice option for the extended sizes"
1297,I was costuming a play and needed gold sweatshirts...couldn't find any in retail stores.  Found these on Amazon and they turned out to be exactly what we needed.  They held up great during a four week run of the show
1298,"You know, after looking at several sites I discovered that it is a little trying to find a simple black flip-flop with no pretentious heirs about it. I finally found it in this shoe. It's your basic run-of-the-mill flip-flop but also has a solid black coloring which looks pretty sharp as well. The sole seems to be pretty durable and the thick nylon strap seems to keep your foot in place. The standard shipment didn't take an exceptionally long amount of time, which I liked, but once the shoes did arrive I discovered that they came in a simple clear plastic bag. No shoe-box given. Normally I wouldn't have mind as they are only flip-flops but as they were ment to be a Christmas gift it would have been nice to have a matching box to wrap them in"
1299,"Product is as described, good quality.  Gloves are not lined, therefore are not as warm as hoped for"
1300,My daughter bought these shoes for her boyfriend and they arrived looking great. He has seemed very pleased with them
1301,The shipping was very fast.  I received the order in a few short days.  The parasol is beautiful.  It is made of silk and it does provide a decent amount of shade.  The previous reviewer was right in that it can be difficult to close.  Otherwise this is a very good purchase
1302,"Sorry for being lazy, but these slippers are very well made, and extraordinarily comfortable.  I've had several pairs of what were meant to be high quality slippers in the past and they did not compare to these.  You would not regret purchasing these"
1303,"Very nice, but this runs real small. I ordered 2, one small and one XL, The XL would be about a medium. Hope this helps others when ordering."
1305,"I'm very satisfied with this purchase. The jeans are great quality for the price. However, it was not stated that they would be the (very)long length that they were. I had to alter them, which was an inconvenience"
1306,I have always wanted a pair of Birkenstocks. I have tried in vain to find that proper fit. I have narrow/slim fit. Birkenstocks are great shoes but not for narrow or slim footed women
1307,"I love these sandals!!  They are so comfortable.  No rubbing or iritation, even the first time I wore them! I usually buy the cheap flip flops, but these were definitely worth the money!"
1308,This is the third pair of these shoes that I have bought in a row and I absolutely love them. They are more comfortable than any other shoe I have worn yet still provide ample cushioning and support. They also come in widths which is a plus when comparing ASICS® to other brands. I highly recommend these shoes for runners of any skill level.
1309,This was shipped as promised.  It arrived quickly and in gift boxes.  I would buy from this seller again
1310,Good quality lining in the front.  I wish there is lining in the back too.  Delivery is fast
1311,"My wife loves this shoe's style, comfort, and durability.  This is why I have confidence in buying an additional pair for her birthday gift.  My wife is an exacting connoisseur of quality and so this is high praise"
1312,"As someone who travels on a weekly basis I have found this travel kit an absolute life saver. When you consider vanishing airline pillows and less than hygenic airline blankets, this is a MUST HAVE item.
The kit comes in a range of great colors,  it includes a full length blanket and matching eye mask."
1313,"I gave this to someone for Christmas, because I have one (similar) and use it as a winter scarf, over a nice dress for a date out, or when I'm cold around the house.  When they opened it, they were really surprised.  I checked it out and the quality was great and the size good for someone larger.  You get alot of bang for your buck here."
1315,"I recently purchased one 100% cotton oxford in blue, and one of the 60/40 blend in white. The shirts arrived in three days, and were of excellent quality. The fabric is not soft, and not scratchy, and is dressy enough to wear with a sport coat or simply a tie, and casual enough to wear as simply a shirt. 

The price is excellent for the value. The only negative is for those of us with larger necks and longer arms, the choice of colors is limited to white and blue."
1316,"I love them, just what I was looking for.  Just like a Berk, but half the price.  My only disatisfaction is that they are not as comfortable as I hoped, but I guess you get what you pay for"
1317,"Hurrah for baby socks of a decent weight and durability. ""For Bare Feet"" took over a deserted high school building west of BEAN BLOSSOM, Indiana, in the mid-eighties. It has built a great reputation for pleasing its customers from infants to men who muscle their way around a football field.

Not only do the Indianapolis Colts' team members welcome any luck that comes their way while wearing adult socks embroidered with the well-known Horseshoe-on-Blue emblem -- but they  aren't surprised if the insignia also catches some luck for babies! Other sports accessories are available ONLINE via amazon.com. or at the company's two outlet shops in the county seat - -  often called ""the OTHER Nashville.""

Miniatures always make appealing baby gifts & these socks make a big hit with Colts' fans everywhere. (Pun intended"
1319,"This is a very heavy, good quality single layer (not two layers sewed together) leather belt. Branded ""Marc Wolf LTD"", ""Made In America"" and ""Top Grain Cowhide"" on the inside. The finish on the leather and the buckle was good with no defects, nicks, or burrs.
A couple of notes to help you buy.
Size:
The size of the belt seems to be to the center of five belt holes.
The five holes span 3 1/2 inches total, so you should be able to go about 1 3/4 inches larger or smaller than the size you ordered.
Extra holes:
To make extra holes a hand held leather punch will work fine. If you are comfortable with power tools you can also drill new holes as needed. Place the belt (finished side down) on a chunk of scrap wood, drill from the back (unfinished inside) side of the belt for best results. Have a friend help you as the leather will try to lift when the drill bit goes through. I had to do this as I ordered 2 inches bigger than I measured just to be safe. 
I am very happy with this product"
1320,"I have to laugh at myself, writing a review for a T-Shirt of all things, but I gotta tell you, this is no ordinary T-shirt!  A year ago I bought one of these shirts in a local store and fell completely in love with it.  It's now a year later, I love it just the same, and I can't find them anywhere, except Amazon (thank God!)  The one I have just happens to have a silkscreen on it, and after a year of constant use (for work) the silkscreen still looks great.  When you compare this shirt to a 100% cotton shirt, these wear MUCH lighter & cooler, even though it says ""heavyweight.""  Don't let that scare you as it's not ""heavy"" at all.  With constant washing over the last year, the Hanes shirt has kept its color, unlike my 100% cotton shirts of the same age which have faded much faster.  Also, if you tend to perspire, these shirts will wick away the moisture more quickly and will not show it nearly as much as a 100% cotton shirt would.  Also nice is that they don't shrink or wrinkle.  I wish I had known about these shirts years ago...  Don't kick yourself years down the road when you buy one of these shirts by accident and wonder where its been all your life (like I did), get it now and enjoy it"
1321,"These slippers are great--nice and warm without being too bulky.  They're super-soft and have a nice anti-slip tread on the bottom.  The only thing I would like is adding a bit more cushion to the bottom of the slipper--otherwise, a fantastic deal in the single-digit dollar amounts.."
1322,Great product with an even better price.  I priced these cleats much higher at a local sporting goods retailer.  My 15 year old son is really enjoying them
1323,Got these for X_mas.  I like them.  I could do without the pockets down by the ankles
1324,"I love my ""Cayman"" Crocs. They were shipped quickly and in good shape. The only problem is now I want more Crocs so I can have more colors.
I have to wear an orthotic insert in my other shoes so I can't usually wear sandles or clogs. These are so comfortable I can wear them all day long without my inserts."
1325,"Clarks sandals are super comfortable, so comfortable I purchased two pairs and came back and purchased a pair of their clogs.  Clarks shoes fit well and they carry larger sizes which I really appreciate.  Good price for great shoes"
1326,For a person with metal allergies this ring was a must have. I've received a lot of compliments on i
1327,I received a quality pair of Adidas Samba Classics at an unbelievable price. They were delivered on time during the Christmas season. I couldn't be happier
1328,These shoes are great. They come in wide which is a neccesity for me. I really like them. The price is pretty high but I think they are worth good running shoes are important. I highly reccomend them.
1329,"Having enjoyed Isotoner slippers for many years, I was sorely disappointed when they changed their sizing/fit several years ago.  The package sizing remained the same, however, they decided to ""scrimp"" on the fabric.  Consequently, newly purchased slippers, though well within my known size range, (supposedly through a 10 1/2) still ran short in the toe (I wear a 10), thus far less comfortable.  Was I sure...you bet.  I still have an ancient pair that when I slip on, are an excellent fit.  

No stores carried sizes beyond XL...until I saw these on Amazon.  I ordered them in XXL and they really do fit.  Re-ordered 2 more pair for each of my daughters (who've had the same problem).

I have to give 4 stars as I've found their overall quality is not quite what it used to be...but at least they fit"
1331,"I received my order in great time,before the Christmas holiday, was pleased with the ease of how to process the order, and the look of the product was even better than the picture.  Thank you and we will do business again.  Travis Evin"
1332,This is the perfect size for kids taking snacks to preschool!  The size in just right for a child that size to carry himself as the strap is too short for an adult.  It even has a see-through name tag on the top where it isn't immediatly visible out in public
1333,"These tanks are very cute.  Infact, I am going to be ordering more for my little guy for the summer"
1334,It's like wearing almost nothing at all. Tired of wearing the same old boxers or briefs? Then you should think of buying this kind of underwear. Nice to wear them in pants or jeans..but I suggest you wear them while you sleep naked.
1335,"I purchased this shoe to replace the Columbia's I had before and am very pleased.  Good comfort fit for my feet.  All feet are different but you tend to find certain manufacturer's seem to consistently work for you.  If you've had Columbia's shoes before, you probably know what it will feel like on your foot.  Good experience purchasing and wearing the shoe.  Nice to avoid having to go to the store"
1337,Comfortable and distinctive.  Everyone asks me about them when I wear them
1338,"This dress was great.  I wore it to a wedding.  I even have a picture where I look like a movie star in it!  However, I was glad I read the review about the sizing - I am normally a medium and I had to get a large to fit me.  Thanks"
1339,"Sizing review is spot-on.  I wear a size 6 street shoe, and my treadmill/track shoes (Adidas Supernova Classics) are 7.5 - The Kumasis I wear are a 6.5.  The first pair I won in a Mudddy Buddy race, and I loved them so much I got a second pair - one for the REALLY muddy, wet days and the other for dusty, drier ones.  Recommended them to my mom and cousin, too, and they love them.  All 3 of us have high arches and narrow heels.  My mom is a AAA width, I'm a B with a narrow heel.  All happy.  Big props to Adidas"
1340,"This items is stretchy, comfortable, and attractively fitted. It shrinks a bit after washing, so if you do not like a fitted style, you will likely not be happy with this. It has a scoop neck that is not too low, and the cap sleeves are flattering."
1341,"These boat shoes are nearly identical to the ones in Bass' catalog. And at a fraction of the cost, I would say they are a super deal. My husband is very pleased and they have a great look and style. If you are in the market for boat shoes, I don't think you can go wrong"
1342,"These are comfortable, cute shoes. Didn't require any break-in time. Toe does turn up a bit, but I really like the look."
1343,Great suit. Always loved speedos. This one has skiny straps for more comfort. Fits well and looks great. Also sizes don't say but a 38 is equivalent to a size 12 womens
1344,"I got these for a lingerie party, but I think they are a little to risque for that, now that said, I wore these all day yesterday and boy did I feel oh so naughty. Of course nobody knew but me. Well, my hubby Jack found out after we put the baby to bed and let me tell you, he was pleased, so pleased I pleased him. These panties need to be hand washed and are made out of Nylon and Spandex. They are made in the USA and are tres elegant. You and your man will just love them to pieces"
1345,"The shirt was exactly what I had expected, but I was unaware that puma sizes run big!  The medium was definitely comparable to a Large anywhere else... but still really like the item!  Good buy"
1346,"I'm 13 and I I love to wear these boxer-briefs because they are so comfortable. I've been into puberty for about 2 years now. They tend to ride up the legs a bit when sitting down. They aren't as thick as the fruit of the loom boxer-briefs, which is better because they don't get as hot. After they are washed and you wear them, they are pretty tight for the first 10 minutes, but after that they are just so loose on the legs. You start to loose some of the support your looking for. I would suggest to get a size smaller than what you really are. I'm a waist size 29 and I should be wearing an XL but they are too loose so I wear the L. Try it out and see if you like them. They are awsome for camp outs and swimming and anything than gets you moving. Great support"
1347,The new style of the T-macs. These are the best. They are very comfartable. I bought them the day they came out. If you are into black then buy them now. Because I know they are coming out in White and Blue so they will have the same pattern as last year. So if you like black buy now if you like white wait till mid December. Otherwise this show is very comfy and better than last year
1348,these shirts are great and the shipment arrived earlier than expected.  Thanks a lot
1350,"I like them. They are seamless over the front, which makes it more comfortable. They stay on the hips with the wide band elastic + no rear crack when bending over. Unlike low rise styles with the small round elastic band. Only problem over time is corner attach points unstitch/tear.
One thing nice about shopping in a store, you can pick though the assorted styles to best match what you like."
1351,"My DH has worn Clark oxfords for some time and says they are the best fitting and most comfortable shoes he has ever owned. This new pair of Clarks, the Citadel Oxford, is his new favorite because it is light weight, casual, and so comfortable."
1352,I know the item arrived on time a it's OK but I don't have it yet; I'm expecting to have it at the end of January when relatives of mine come back to Argentina but as I know everything is OK. Thanks a lot. Bert
1354,This is a nice casual skirt for a reasonable price. The quality is fine. Suede is soft and nice looking. The size is accurate. Good deal for the money spent. Five stars
1355,"These are great girl socks! Besides being economical, they feel good, wash good, are very stylish, and don't fall down! They look great with jeans and khakis. I have ordered several more pairs, in different colors. A true value"
1356,"I received this as a christmas gift after putting it on my wish list. Its hard to know exactly how large it is, but its a great bag none the less. It is huge, so its not great for an everyday bag. But I use it for work, and it works great, and holds all I need. I have received many compliments on it as well"
1357,"These are probably one of my favorite articles of clothing. I am a frequent (normally 5+ times a week) endurance runner, and I have found these to be a great addition to my gym bag. Whenever it's too chilly to wear shorts, I'll pull on my Underarmour coldgear leggings and throw my shorts on top of them. Thay keep my legs nice and warm without overheating them.

I also tend to use these as a base layer under everything from jeans to my dress pants whenever it's cold out. Again, they keep my legs warm , but not too warm.

I also like the fit of these leggings. They are tight around the legs, providing good muscle support and compression (good for reducing injuries and soreness), without being too uncomfortable in the crotch and rear (provided you don't wear anything under them -- yes, they are supposed to be worn as underwear). They also have what feels like a synthetic microsuede interior, which just ads to the overall comfort level.          

I have heard a few people complain that underarmour heat gear keeps them a bit too cold, especially when they don't wear anything on top. I like to be slightly cooler when running, so these work for me. If you can't stand being a bit on the cool side, you probably shouldn't leave any part of the tights uncovered (wear something over that completely covers them), but if you don't, yo won't be shivering either"
1359,"Of all men's silk PJs that I purchased over the years for my husband this is one of the best.  The fabric has a nice heavy weight to it and it survives machine washing well.  After reading other customers' reviews, I purchased a medium size for a person who usually wears size M and occasionally L.  It turned out too small.  I would recommend going one size up"
1360,"I didnt go to the baby shower that I had bought these for, but was told everyone thought they were funny and the mother to-be couldnt wait until she could use them. They looked like they were good quality, and the price was great"
1362,These shoes are very comfortable. I have them in other colors that have lasted several years so far. Great if you have to walk a lot in your job
1363,"These shoes are stunning, original and over-the-top beautiful. I just can't understand the review regarding the point of the shoe being too pointy?? Square-toe shoes are soooo late 90-s and these shoes are anything, but ""mosquito hunters"". They have a perfect narrow shape, with an interesting mix of fabrics and a PERFECT toe for the current late decade of 2000. Trust me, with 117 pairs in my exploding New York closet these have ended up at the front. I'm picking up the black ones as I'm writing this. Enjoy them....I know you as well as your better half will!"
1364,I looked at hundreds of soccer T-shirts on line.  This one stood out.  My niece loves it too - the colors and the design.  It is well-made with beautiful colors.  I wish I'd gotten one for myself
1365,"I bought a white one of these bras at the hospital baby boutique after the sales person fitted me. Then I bought the other two colors at Amazon.com from a 3rd party seller that was offering free shipping. I was surprised to find any nursing bras that fit me. But the hospital boutique was able to find 2 or three styles that worked for me. However, this one was the only one that was not an underwire bra and I hate underwires. This one is comfortable enough to sleep in. I wear them with the Medela Cotton Washable Bra Pads. 

The only drawback is that it looks like a sports bra with no separation, but with my size, I care more about comfort than looks."
1366,"I needed something to carry on a Hawaii Tour that would hold everything I needed & then some.  I really liked all the different sized pockets inside & outside.  I could carry it over my shoulder or lengthen the strap & wear it across the front.  It held (on occasion) all of my necessities, my cell phone, our itinery folder, camera & video batteries, plus the video camera!  It wasn't too heavy to carry, even with all of my stuff in it.  I love this bag!"
1367,"I bought this for my wife as a gift and she loves it. It is soooo comfortable!! Why do girls always get the soft and comfortable night wear, and us boys get stuck with flannel??!! HA!!

Thanks..."
1368,Bought these for my son and was very happy with the quality of the shoes. Bought them on a sale. Well worth the money spent! They appear that they will withstand my very energetic and tough on shoes 4 yr. old
1369,This product is great. Their are a ton of different ways to use this bag. From rolling it to carrying it like a backpack. I would advise anyone looking for luggage to look at this piece and no other. It is great.
1370,"It is really hard to find a sports bra in the size I needed.  I reccomend this bra for those of you who are big chested, but still want to exercise without having your chest flop around"
1371,Very pleased with the purchase. These shoes are comfortable and durable
1372,"I absolutely love this sports bra. I have a very hard time finding sports bras that fit (i'm a 32C, and most things are still too big around the rib area). But this bra is perfect, I love that you can adjust the side straps for an even more comfortable fit.  I would recommend this bra to anybody and will definitely be buying a few more"
1374,This is the first Leather jacket I purchased. Holds up well. And I usually wear it when I ride my Motorcycle
1375,"I have been trying to find low heeled sandals with a back strap and no thing between the toes so I was very excited to find these. I bought 4 pairs (silver, bronze, black, and turquoise). They are beautiful and comfortable (I walked around at Disneyland in the turquoise ones from 9am to midnight!) The sizing was very true and the standard shipping was very fast. I highly recommend both these sandals and Amazon.com"
1376,i like it a lot. i wear it as a beret type thing not as a ski hat. its cute
1377,the leather wrist cuff is exactly what I wanted and it is exactly what it looked like on line Very Please
1378,"I bought a pair in black.  They fit perfectly and are soooo comfy.  The bottom of the shoe is zigzag so it flexes easily like you're not wearing shoes.  I gave it four stars cuz I had to cut off the tassel since it looks like worms hanging off your shoe (which was real easy) and the bottom of the shoe is not completely covered with rubber, part of it is suede so you can't wear it near water.  Otherwise very comfy and cute"
1379,"I can only say that Ron must have some ""exceptionally located"" plumbing. I have worn only Munsingwear for 14-15 years now. And, when it came to the ever-important preludes to lovemaking, my girlfriends all preferred the easy access horizontal fly also. Vertical flys are quite inferior to the horizontal style, in my well-qualified opinion. I cannot understand why horizontal is not the ""standard"" rather than vertical. Come to think of it, my first pair of the easy access horizontals were given to me by a girlfriend"
1380,Im 13 & am getting into puberty. This underwear helps alot in school because I get sudden erections. One time in gym we were changing and I looked at another guy and got one and thanks to these briefs they hid it so no one saw it. Also their a big hit with your boyfriend to cause my bf loves it and he wears them for the same reason
1381,"I bought this robe and the silk pajamas for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day, both in a size large. The pajamas fit nicely, but the robe was WAY too big! I printed out the return label listing the reason for return as the product did not fit the description online. Amazon said that this was not their fault and deducted the cost of shipping from my refund, and did not offer the opportunity for an exchange. So, now I have to re-order the robe in a smaller size, and the price has gone up $7 since Valentine's Day. This would have been a good deal if it had run true to size, but because of misrepresentations made I will end up paying close to the full price listed. 
MORAL: Order one size smaller than you think you need."
1382,"But, they run kinda small.  Order 1/2 size up.  Why isn't there a 9 1/2"
1383,"Great Boots! I am not sure if the teen liked them or not because it was an Angel Tree (anonymous giver and receiver) gift for children of incarcertated parents.  But, I loved them"
1384,"I bought this gift for my husband for our first Christmas.  He absolutely loved it--the color, the texture, everything.  After searching around on the internet, it was one of the best deals, as well.  The gift arrived quickly and without any problems.  I highly recommend"
1386,"After reading all the reviews, I contemplated about purchasing the dress for more than 1 month before actually ordering it.  The price is really hard to beat and the style is simple but elegant and unique.  I particularly like the small train that fans out with the bead works.  I am a petite 5'2"" weighing <115.  I was not sure if I should order the small or medium so I wrote and asked the sales people and they suggested me a small which turned out to fit me quite well except for the length.  The dress is a few inches too long for me even with my 2inch-high heel"
1387,"This jacket is a great find! The price is unbeatable for the quality.. it is so soft and plush. It's very warm, and not heavy at all. It fits true to size. I have the color ""Bullet"" and its a solid medium gray. It looks great with everything from jeans to sweats! I can't wait to try it out on a cold winter run"
1388,"I like this shoe very much.  Soft and supple.  Seems wide, but still fits my size"
1389,i bought this pair of shoes for my dad and he just loves it..he loves to go for running and he is absolutely amazing with its comfort and ease..five stars to this.
1390,This is  a great backpack for a 10 year old. It works great for school. The one strap feature is really fast for our early morning get out the door rush. I will get another when this one wears out
1391,"I wished every pair of shoes made were this comfortable. I bought a new pair to replace my old pair. I agree with the previous reviewer that the design is slightly informal. Even so, I wonder why other companies don't make similar products to Comfortech"
1392,"This is one of the best workout investments one can make. It makes your skin feel cool even under a T-shirt. In a breeze or at a run the effect is amplified. I was hesitant to try it at the price, but I don't play or practice without it now"
1393,"This jacket and pants are not the high end breathable rain gear you want on a week long backpacking trip. This is the rain gear you keep in your pickup truck for when you least expect. It will keep you perfectly dry. You will sweat a little on a warm day, but it is well worth the money for a cheap, dependable and totally waterproof suit. enjoy the rain and mud."
1395,"I have to say, those crocs are the best. they are super confi, and light... I recommend them"
1396,"It took so long for the item to arrive;but once they got here. The item was form fitting, comfortable, but the pant legs were way to extended(overly wide). Aside from the alterations, these pants were better than the regular army / navy store purchase."
1397,This bra rocks! No bulging over holds them in a lovely natural position!! I SO reccomend this to anyone frustrated by overpriced bras
1399,I really like this shoe. The only draw back is that the leather is not as soft as I would like. I think they will be perfect once they have been broken in
1401,"At 6 1/2 months old my baby isn't walking yet, but when we go out I put these on her feet with our without shoes. She moves her legs a lot and usually kicks off any shoes and socks on. These stay on better than any we've tried. She can't pull them off easily. They are holding up very well in the wash and the  colors match the colors used in baby's outfits on the market - which is very nice. The ""non-slip"" part is the printing on the bottom of the feet that says ""Loveable Friends"". It is a soft rubberish kind of printing that feels very nice to the fingers. We started using these when our baby had just turned 5 months old and they stayed on just as well then. They seem like they will fit her for another few months. Overall these are very nice socks for a good price. I highly recommended them."
1402,This nightgown turned out to be just what I was looking for but hadn't been able to find in the department stores.  I purchased it for my elderly aunt who wanted a gown just like the one she had worn for many years.  It is good quality which is what I was expecting from Vanity Fair
1403,"Product is great.But...

Did not understand what number equivalent translates to large.  Herroom charges far too much for shipping and handling in comparrison to others"
1404,"Functionally, these shoes are great.  They feel really good.  I get good support on my problem feet, and I no longer have knee pain after running.  

I guess the only draw back is that these shoes look like ""medical"" shoes.  The kind that would be prescribed to old folks with foot problems"
1405,I received the shoes in a timely fashion and love wearing them
1406,This one actually WORKS!  The others I have tried rolled down and made your situation worse looking!  And these are easy to wash....I just throw mine in a mesh pantihose bag and in the washer....comes out perfect!  Love them!
1407,"I bought this shirt for my crew practice just to have something on to keep off the chill but not get caught on the oars. Great texture and whicks off any sweat fast. 
It's not exactly under armour but for the price you're paying, it's pretty damn close"
1408,"Shoe was as described.  And for a stylish pair, it was well worth the price.  Free S/H and No Tax charged was a great added feature"
1409,"I bought these boots when they were on sale. Definitely worths the money! they look great with skinny jeans tucked in, and they are really comfortable. Whoever saw my boots loved them"
1410,I have been very happy with this briefcase.  I am a first-year law student and use it heavily for both my books and my computer and it is holding up well.  I would recommend it highly
1411,"I bought this robe and the silk pajamas for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day, both in a size large. The pajamas fit nicely, but the robe was WAY too big! I printed out the return label listing the reason for return as the product did not fit the description online. Amazon said that this was not their fault and deducted the cost of shipping from my refund, and did not offer the opportunity for an exchange. So, now I have to re-order the robe in a smaller size, and the price has gone up $7 since Valentine's Day. This would have been a good deal if it had run true to size, but because of misrepresentations made I will end up paying close to the full price listed. 
MORAL: Order one size smaller than you think you need."
1413,Thanks for the quick shipment of my Steve Madden shoes.  They are brand-new as described
1414,"I really like hellokitty, and I was delighted to find this set. It's wicked cute"
1415,The hat is very well made.  I decided to buy it to support the people in all our services.
1416,The sneakers arrived in a timely manner and the price I paid was way below the price for these sneakers
1418,I bought this bag to carry books one mile each way from the parking lot to the building.  It already has a lot of miles on it.  It is easy to use - I like the front pocket with easy access to pens and calculator.  I have had to clean the wheelwells twice - my route is not solely sidewalk.  The case otherwise still looks like new.  Just what I needed
1419,"I purchased one of these a while ago and I just fell in love with it. I have since purchased a few more from Amazon. They so comfy and silky and I really love the design, how it sits higher on the chest. They are also very stretchy and not binding at all. Definitely my favorite camisole."
1420,"When I first received these, a present for my 18 yr old son, I was rather surprised at the trim cut of the shearling. But he wore them and was very pleased. He's very active outdoors and liked that they were thinner but warm, offering him a better grip.  I wore them myself to shovel some snow once and they kept my hands nice and warm."
1422,"This shirt is so funny. I actually want to buy it, which is rare since I normally silkscreen all my shirts. For anyone who is sick of all the davinci hype(like me), thinks all those ""craking the davinci code"" authors who should write there own damn book(like me) or just want a shirt with a toad on mona lisa's face(not like me, but to each there own.) This shirt would be perfect. I would buy it myself, but there out of small's."
1423,"This is my favorite bra.  I bought $60 nursing bras and grabbed this one on the way out and it turned out to be the best.  It is soft, comfortable, has good support, great straps, a lot of hooks in the back (to make looser or tighter), and has a perfect sized opening for breast feeding.  Some bras have too small or too big an opening and make breast-feeding difficult.  This bra is great.  I have almost stopped breastfeeding and still wear it!"
1424,Nice detail on a basic shoe.  Good in comfort for a long day on my feet
1425,"The reviewer below hit it on the head. If you want your boys to ride in comfort all day long, and want to not even notice your underwear all day long...believe me the thong is a LOT less annoying than either boxer briefs or especially briefs. And, yeah, the wife likes me in em too, but the real bonus is the all-day comfort. Guys...you'd better try these things. Try all kinds, but this one is near the top of my list. Lots of room and no binding.

Go slowly...buy one thong at a time and make sure it fits before buying moe of the same kind! Some fight tight...others loose"
1427,these rule over all other underwear. calvin klein does it almost as good but these are the best and when you see a pair you should bow
1428,"I just got these and love them.  My only complaint is that they pinch/are a little narrow, even though I don't have wide feet or regularly wear wide shoes.  The dark red color is a little deeper than the picture, but that is a good thing if you want to wear these in both winter and summer.  If you're gonna buy red shoes or any other colors available, these are a great choice"
1429,"Putting on socks for my daughter was always a nightmare for both of us.  She would kick and scream, ""Line! Line! Line!!!"" Socks and shoes would go flying across the room and we would both break down in total frustration.  So I looked up the seamless socks on Amazon and found these.  I checked out the reviews and decided to buy.  The triple pack of just white socks was not available in my daughter's size.  Being the desperate mom that I was, I opted for the pink, ivory, and white combo.  They came to my home within a week.  Mornings have never been so good.  Needless to say I am back on the internet ordering more.  These socks are just amazing.  Who knew that putting on socks was no big deal"
1430,"Arrived promptly, in excellent condition and for $45.00 less than in stores"
1431,I needed this item for a gift and it arrived in great condition right on time.
1432,"I bought the white one to tease my husband on our honeymoon.  I told him if I had to wear lingerie so should he.  He actually wore it and it looked great on him, however/therefore I would never have him leave the house in it.  We did not test it in water but I would guess it would be quite see through.  If you are not in really great shape or would feel uncomfortable if others saw you naked, I would not recommend it for use in public because it will show every detail of your physique and it is tiny (very little coverage of ""stuff"").  Please also never get it wet in public (or wear it at all), especially if children are present, that would just be all kinds of icky.  However, in the right private setting, wearing it may just ""WOW"" the right lady!"
1433,I really like this wallet at first.  It has all kinds of little spaces for the multitude of cards and ID's I have to carry around.  The reason I knocked it down to four stars is because the outside has begun to wear a little earlier than I expected.  Not to the point of needing replaced yet but still noticeable.  I'd estimate it'll last about two years
1434,Best priced for this item online. Great merchant with fast delivery and caring customer service. Will be buying lots of these
1435,"Lands End's turtleneck sweaters and mock turtlenecks, with long and short sleeves, have been staples in my wardrobe for almost ten years now.  I own them in multiple colors, and they look as nicely with dress suits I wear at the office as with jeans and leisure wear.  In addition, they are virtually indestructible; few other garments I own survive laundry this well - no matter how often I wash them, they don't fade, thin out or shrink.  They're first-rate quality, and at a bargain price to boot"
1436,My daughter is happy with this purchase and her friends like it to
1437,Many fashionable shoes keep that as their main focus.  This is my second pair of Tsubos and I am continually impressed by the incredible comfort and durability they provide while maintaining its stylishness.
1438,"I purchased these shoes as a Christmas gift for my husband.  He's been wearing it a lot.  He says it's comfortable, and he has not experienced the squeeking from the shoes as some other reviews had pointed out.  I was hoping it has more of a dressier look.  It really looks better with jeans and not as good with kahki's"
1440,"This individual pair of bikers shoes was a tad smaller than the other 2 pairs that I own of the same size.  However, am able to wear them"
1441,"I am very happy with the above purchase.I am very impressed with the arrival and condition of the item. I like it because it fits well and when you wear it, you feel quite cool. Will shop agai"
1442,"Clogs were recommended to me by a nurse because i was having some trouble with arthritis in my knee.  I was told they would distribute the weight of my body in a more comfortable manner.  I found these Rockports on Amazon and they have been under my desk at work since.  As soon as i get to work i slip into them

Besides being really comfortable to walk in (they are like having super shock absorbers under your feet) they have a nice sassy look with out the discomfort of a high heel!  

I love them"
1443,"I highly reccommend this bag for anyone! It is a big tote, which is perfect for a college campus, the airport, the beach... really for any purpose. It is reversable and I was very suprised at how durable it is (great quality). When people compliment the bag it allows an opportunity to share its cause- which in the end is the most important part."
1444,Do you have a hard time finding quality black socks?  Don't buy the Fluffy version since it will just make your foot sweat.  This sock can be worn hundreds of times before the heal will become low.  Cool in the summer and warm in the winter.  Never itches or scratches.  Stays up and not too tight.  The perfect sock
1445,My daughter runs high school track and has used several pairs of these shoes.  They run slightly small as she normally takes size 8 but needs 8.5 in these.  She has low arches
1446,The shoes are extremely comfortable and light weight.  I definitely got my money's worth.
1448,"I bought the Krona wedge sandal because Clark is known for quality and comfort. I was impressed by Clark's new styles, especially the Indigo selection. The reason I chose this shoe was that I wanted some height and I needed something comfortable. Walking is pleasant due to the shock absorbing base. 
These shoes have recieved many compliments... might I add, they have a beautiful sole, also. Definitely a shoe worth wearing!"
1450,"I'm not typically a shoe person, usually I tend to own one pair of sneakers until they basicly disintergrate from use.  However with converse's I found a shoe that I actually really did enjoy wearing.  Often people complain that the converse's are overly trendy and that's the only reason for the popularity.  However I currently own 2 pairs, might consider getting another, and will probably keep with the brand for life due to their conform and easy to wear style"
1451,I was having a hard time finding a cheaper swim suit so I just ordered one from the grab bag.  I figured nothing could be worse than my plain black swim suit.  Also the swim suit was delivered in half the time that it was expected
1452,"I'm pleased with the look and fit of these sandals.  My only complaint is that the sole is very slick, so walking is tricky.  Once I put something rough on the bottom these sandals will be perfect.  At least the heel is not slick, thank goodness.  These sandals are very comfortable"
1453,I got the NFL folding tail gate chair to enjoy those times in the park and ball field and especially at draft day for the NLF. waiting on line for hours dressed in your favorite team outfit (Go Vikings) to show support. and nothing shows it more then relaxing on line sitting in these football folding chairs in your teams color and emblem. it does beat standing for hours or sitting on a cold dirty sidewalk
1454,"The items were fine, but they were all shipped individually and arrived and different time spread out over a 4 week period. The item was not what i expected though and i returned them. The return was hassel fre"
1455,"This little scale can pay for itself many times over, and grants peace of mind as you approach check in.  I purchased two, one for my Australian friend who always overpacks and has to pay at the gate for overweight luggage.  It is more accurate than bathroom scales.  If you are by yourself, hold it in front of a mirror."
1456,"Very sexy and confortable panty.  This is ideal for use under thight pants.

Also while you are at it why don't buy your man a thong?  Thongs look incredibly sexy and masculine on men. all my girfriends convinced their men to use thongs and now they love it"
1457,I am totally satisfied with the merchant and the product
1458,"This is a great fit for a silk shirt. I thought it would not be a close fit being silk, but I was wrong. This item fits snug and looks great on. Both alone and layered.  I would recommend this shirt to people that like the look of a tight tank."
1459,"This is a great blanket!  The back is a water-resistant material so you don't get wet when sitting on damp grass.  The top is a soft cotton type material.  The blanket is lightly padded to keep you comfortable from hard ground and small pebbles.  It's machine washable. It folds up easily to fit back in the matching tote bag that it comes packed in.  It's large enough to hold two adults, a baby and all of the baby's play things. I'm so glad I purchased this and I look forward to many years of use"
1460,Oh my gosh!  I was so excited to see this item.  My 15 year old and all of his buddies are big fans of Napoleon Dynamite and this t-shirt is an exact replica of the one worn during the famous election rally dance!  I will be a hit on Valentine's Day with this gift!
1461,"I have been wearing these slippers, everyday, for 3 years!  They are a blessing for my cold feet!  Not to mention the durability.  I just now realized the sole was broken almost in 1/2 from years of use.  I was frantic when I looked and looked and could not find them.  

Today is my lucky day, I just ordered my second pair"
1462,"True to the Ugg reputation, these slippers are great! Warm & toasty - I live in them at home~fit is right on"
1464,I purchased several pairs of these gloves.  They arrived quickly in the mail.  I am very pleased with the quality and price.  We use them as puppeteers to keep a firm grip inside the puppet's mouth.  Great item
1466,I was pleasantly surprised by the comfort of the shoe.It looks much classier on than in the illustration I am buying a few more pair in different colors at the low price
1467,"I'm 6'6"", 270, and I love these shoes.  After having them for two weeks, I bought 3 more pairs.  Being a big guy, with bad arches, and crappy ankles, I go through shoes like crazy.  When I find good ones, I stock up.  These are without doubt the best shoes I've ever owned"
1468,I really like this wallet.  There really is not a whole lot you can say about a wallet.  It has alot of room and it is very nice
1470,"These are great slacks for the price.  Comfortable and not apt to wrinkling for a bit as it says.  The sidebanding helps with slacks being typically smaller/tighter/less forgiving than jeans.  The olive and black colors look somewhat more professioanl than the rest.  

The only caveat is that they aren't cuffed, so it doesn't look dressy- but it's dressy enough to go to work and not worry it if they get ruined.  At 25 bucks, it rivals old navy pricing, but without the infantile look or no stock issues they have.  Oh, and these suckers shipped in 2 days from Joseph Bank.  Fastest I've ever gotten an order from amazon or their resellers.  Very nice.    It's durable/nice looking and just works"
1471,"If you will ever just try these one time, you will be hook forever"
1473,"I have these in both black and brown, and I wear them nearly every day. I walk to work and back and other than the first day of use, they required very little break in and they are just comfortable and great.

Note that my feet are not wide, I have no idea what the width of my foot is, but I just buy normal sizes when I get shoes - if you have to go wider, perhaps this would not be the boot for you.

The only downside is that I normally wear a 13 in shoes - but these are too big for me at that size, so I really should have gotten a 12."
1475,I bought this case and it works very well. Some people have complained about scratched but I havent noticed any. There is a slight stcky residue but it comes off fairly easily. The only real complainted i have is that the case covers part of the top of the screen. Overall its a good case
1476,"I am so happy with my Bella Band bundle purchase, and so happy I bought the pack of 3.  I was hesitant to spend the money on these but after searching the net for this and similar products figured I'd give it a try.  
BUY THESE EARLY LADIES!  I waited until my 24th week to buy the bands and today slipped on a pair of pants I haven't worn in 2 months, unbuttoned and unzipped even, but nobody could tell with the bella band on.  The look was cute and layered and not bunchy.  The nice material even felt great under my shirt and no more belly button 'hole' showing!
I'm going up to my 'skinny clothes' box to pull out items I can wear with my bella band on. I'm so excited to use this now and post-pregnancy.
PS - they even came with a nice surprise bag of Skittles, heaven to me"
1477,"It's only been the last 7 years or so that I've enjoyed wearing a robe around the house, I admit I used to be walking around in my underwear when I woke up in the morning!  All of my previous robes were typically off the clearance racks, and mostly some kind of inexpensive terrycloth.

I bought this becuase my last robe is falling apart.  I have to say that although I hesitated to spend 100 bucks on a robe, when it got here and I wore it for a couple days, I really like it.

I bought the Large Black robe; I'm 6ft, about 200lbs, a little heavy around the middle, and the robe fits pretty well.  The arms are baggy and the sleeves are long enough to touch the back of my hand just after the wrist.  The length extends to just about the bottom of my calf muscle in my legs.  It ""flows"" nice too, when I walk, not like the heavier terrycloth robe.  And the silk lining makes me feel ""rich""!

Overall, I like it"
1478,I have sensitive hands and most gloves are too tight or too loose and never warm enough.  These gloves are such a comfortable fit and actually keep the cold out.  I love them
1479,"great brand, my FAVORITE. high quality, withstands tons of washing. very very well made and quite soft"
