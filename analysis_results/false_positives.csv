10,"I found the band underneath the cups rolled under and wasn't very elastic...very uncomfortable.  It fit great when I tried it in the store
(even had it fit to me by a Medela rep) but after a few wearings, the band
issue just soured the deal.  Also, I had a hard time getting the cup fasteners hooked with just one hand.  The fasteners are pretty fiddly.  My favorite bras are, by far, the Bravado line!"
67,This is the only Haynes T-shirt that does not bunch at the back of the neck. It is light and drapes well. But it is too light for printing.
131,"i know they're cute bunnies, but the hole to put your foot in is to small to actually put your foot in.  i don't know who designed these things, but they didn't think it through.  i ended up sending mine back, so after tax i paid about $15 for them,  then i shipped them back for another $6,  and i got refunded $9.99.  WTF"
151,"I was really looking forward to recieving these ""MEMORY FOAM"" slippers. When they arrived I was EXTREMELY disappointed to discover that they only had a ""RUBBER"" sole with terry cloth. (The terry cloth and color were beautiful and the size 11 narrow was great on the fit.)  I hope the factory just forgot to put the memory foam in this particular pair of slippers because if that is not the case then this company is guilty of false and misleading claims in their online product discription, as well as, the discription on the attached tag.  I returned these slippers the day after they arrived and am still in search of a pair of slippers WITH real memory foam that the wearer can actually feel"
159,"for $30, i guess i cant complain but this are not good looking or comfortable shoe"
168,"This a very basic black boot. I choose these because I was 5 months pregnant at the time and wanted something a bit stylish yet low to the ground to help me avoid trips or falls. If you are into a very basic, minimalist look, these boots are for you. If not, stick with stalletos -- always my first choice"
190,"Maybe I'm naive, but I never could figure out how the hooks came out of the keycase. They are spring-loaded, and they turn. A certain combination of push or twist or pull seems necessary to get them out. I got one out by sheer accident but that is it. And there are no directions included. So I'm back to a keyring and that's not so bad."
211,"While I was a little wary of ordering a jacket for $20 online, I went ahead and ordered this one. It seemed like it was made of durable material, and looked snazzy. When it came in the mail today, it was stuffed in a first class envelope with another t-shirt [which I really like!]. I was anxious to see what it was like.

This jacket is /literally/ made of the material used for FedEx envelopes. Sounds cool, huh? The jacket is extremely thin, and feels like you're wearing a paper bag. While I appreciate the prompt service of the people at Andrew Christian, they will probably see my jacket returned within the next couple of weeks"
218,"The leather on these gloves is soft and supple. and they're warm

thats about all that I can say that is good. There were scuffs when I got them. the stitching was ripping (and finished itself off soon after) and the fingers were different lengths on each glove. avoid at all costs."
325,"This shoe is very comfortable, unfortunately I had to send it back to the manufacturer twice, the second time choosing a different style shoe because the net material comes loose from the seems where the laces are. I am very dissapointed as I have come to expect quality from Merrell and these shoes fall apart in a few weeks.  I would recommend a different shoe as this one will last you between 1 and 3 weeks before ripping"
332,The product I recieved looked just like the picture. It shipped very fast and when the product wasn't exactly what my husband was looking for (he is kinda picky) The company had no problem with refunding my money. I reccomend the seller to anyone. Very easy to work with! Thanks a bunch
339,"I have ordered Intimo silk boxers in the past and have been happy with that purchase. So far the fabric in these cotton boxers is extremely stiff and they have not gotten any softer even after 4 washings. I will continue to wash these in hopes that the fabric will soften enough to be comfortable enough to be worn. I now know why I pay $15.00 for two pair of
Jockey's"
374,Dilvered quickly in time for Christmas. Sweatshirt was great quality
414,"Unfortunately the pads made my skin break out and gave me a painful rash.  I think that if they work for you, they would be wonderful, but if you have sensitive skin, they are not for you.  I love the idea. I am a leaky faucet and I would love an easy breast pad that worked.  I am sick of sleeping with my bra on. Hopefully by the time I have my next child, they will come up with something even more breathable"
438,"So I ordered this shirt and I got an entirely diffent one, the packing slip had the right order #. The shirt I received was long sleeved, crew neck with a notch in it. Ans when I called them,the person I spoke to was not the least bit shocked/ amazed or even willing to send the right one, she just said send it back... think twice unless you don't mind making trips to the post offic"
452,"ordered size XXL for my brother for christmas, he said it fit great overall but it was too short! he's 6'5"" and ussually an XXL sweatshirt fits just fine all over, including length. He loved the sweatshirt, so was disappointed that he had to return it"
491,"Within two hours of recieving my complaint the seller refunded my money, without requriing that I ship the product back.  For that I am thankful and appreciative, and can recommend the seller. I have no idea what was up with the product.

As I noted earlier, I just recieved this product and it has the overwhelming smell of petroleum, literally like the smell that comes from an oil truck delivering fuel oil to your home.  I bought this for a child and would never dream of giving it to them.  I am contacting the seller to request a refund.  If I succeed I will note that in the review and increase the star rating"
509,"I order this shoe in a size 9...it fits and feels like an 8 1/2.  I wonder what happened.  I also order the Black and Tan, both fit and feel like a 9.  What happened??"
516,"They are adorable shoes, but I have some other flats from Soda that are more comfortable. I have wide feet though, so that might explain why I feel so cramped in them"
530,"The pants were really nice, but they were too large for my son.  I requested an exchange (same style & color) in size medium.  To date, I have NOT received the exchange.  Could you please look into this for me.

Thanks,
Bonnie Cutle"
535,"Pro's: I got my package within three days. I did recieve what I ordered. The size charts were a big help and the pants fit pretty good.
Con's: On the description it says the scrubs have a high thread count and our made of non see through material. That is wrong!  The pants are soo see through that you can see the color of my legs and my white undergarments"
563,"They run MUCH smaller than Birkenstocks. I sent the size 44 back (which is comfy in the comparable model in Birkenstocks; is it the Boston?) and got the 45 and it STILL feels small. The upper is ok, the shoe isn't the best made thing but is adequate; it's just the size thing that bothered me"
571,"I loved the concept of this item, but it didn't live up to my expectations.  The top was extremely loose in the bra portion and provided no support.  The pants, however, were comfortable and I really loved them.  

The top needs to be reworked"
574,"These were the most uncomfortable shoes I've ever put on my feet.  (I say ""were"" because I threw them in the trash after 4 hours of wear).  They are cute, though"
692,"Do not waste your money on this one. Champion Men's Cap Sleeve Raglan T-Shirt, Oxford Gray/Navy, X-Large."
700,"Be forewarned! Never mind all the mellifluous flubdrub about nature-formed last, footwear classic, nineteen sixty-five, etc. The facts of the matter are that (a) the Irish factory where Wallabees were handmade with love closed down in the late 1990s; (b) the product has been made in mainland China since that time; (c) the materials and workmanship don't begin to come close to their former standards, which is duly reflected in the downward price shift ($180 in 1998 but $110 in 2006, inflation notwithstanding); yet (d) the Web sites--which claim that the shoe is ""even better""--seem to have no problem with posting photos of the no-longer-available Irish craftsewns while shipping the Chinese hack jobs. Very, very disappointing, gentlemen.  (I once found a fellow in Ottawa who had bought up considerable quantities of sand suede Wallabees and was selling them at a premium--$225--that I was happy to pay, but even he ultimately went out of business, just like Peter, my custom Birkenstock sandalmaker in Germany.)

I once phoned the vendor to complain, and some imbecile tried to explain to me that the product was ""better than ever."" I flew into a rage, telling her what she could do with her lies. I also chastised her for having the brass-bound gall to lie to me, a diehard Wallabee fan who has continuously owned (and worn, day in and day out) several pairs--sand suede, oakwood suede, brown leather, and/or black leather--since the age of fifteen, two-thirds of a lifetime ago! (The oakwood [= dark brown] suede were always my favorites, since the sand suede always looked a little too smart-Alecky for me, making me look [quite accurately!] like an upper-middle-class New York City Jewish boy--just mate them with Sergio Valente jeans, a creamy velour shirt, and an ultra-expensive sweater.)

All that having been vented, the Wallabee is still a reasonably comfortable shoe--assuming you can find two members of a pair that actually match within a reasonable margin of deviation! Teenage kids won't know the difference, but baby-boomers will be moved to tears. Get with the program and buy either a pair of those ultra-advanced, computer-designed, ruggedized flip-flops (there are scores of vendors) or some quality suede sneakers (leather ones are far too oppressive for the educated foot). CAVEAT EMPTOR!"
702,"These would be great boots if you had some way of knowing what size to order.  I emailed Western Chief for a size chart.  I then ordered my son's boots according to the size chart Western Chief sent me.  Once I received the boots I was upset to see that the boots were over 1 inch larger than the size chart showed - this is a big deal for a child's boot.  I then called Western Chief and explained the situation and asked to get an actual measurement of a few other sizes so I could order the correct boots.  I spoke with a Ms. Brewer, who was rather rude, she told me she would have to go to the warehouse to measure the boots and she would call me back.  Of course that was a week ago.  
I luckily found very similar boots at Target - problem solved.
How could a company have a shoe size chart that is so wrong?  The bad customer service was just the cherry on top  :"
716,"I had been looking for fingerless gloves to wear while I type-- they keep the office I work at at very cold temperatures.  These gloves seeemed perfect--because many fingerless gloves- don't have fingerless thumbs--but these gloves do.  The cost was only 2.99 for a pair of black or navy gloves.  I ordered the black pair.  Well, the knit gloves began to fray on the first wearing- there are many stray strands at the fingers-- they snag easily.  They are warm and I would love them if they did not snag and fray so easily.  But I did only pay 2.99 for them so I guess it's a case of you get what you pay for."
718,"Big for the size advertised, not fitting as snugly for pear shaped gals. Hoped it would shrink, since I'm a perfect 6, and it didn't. Disappointed"
803,"My ""tween"" daughter loves these Saucony Jazz shoes.
They are comfortable and stylish.
This is her 3rd pair.
I'm glad that I found them online.
They are both old-school and stylish"
806,"Ordered mens 6.5 for my son, shoes are sized a womans 6.5 (say mens 6.5 on box and shoe).  I'm going to have to pay $6.50 to return them for a larger size.  Don't waste your money, Buy NIkes"
861,"I am glad I listened to the reviewer that mentioned the Ankle Pain. I thought these shoes were very cute and exactly what I needed for my trip to Florida. They are indeed very cute on -- but run a half size large so buy a half-size down. I ended up returning them because I wore them around the house, and noticed my ankles were being forced to bend inwards. The size was correct, but the shoe is built to angle inward. I didn't wear them long enough to have pain, but it definitely was getting uncomfortable. The other annoying thing was the straps wouldn't stay shut, the velcro kept releasing. I was constantly re-fastening them just the short time I wore them. The style is perfect, I hope Skechers tweaks this model to fix what is wrong. I ended up buying the Skechers Bikers Tailgater (runs true to size), which is similar but has a better velcro strap, and have suede inserts where the mesh ones are on the Sightseers (I would have preferred the mesh given I was buying them for Florida)"
938,"Not only do they make me look frumpy, the stretchy belly portion of these pants start about 3 inches higher than the pubic bone, which makes them pull very tight when sitting down, especially in the later months of pregnancy. They fit fine at 5 or 6 months along, but at 9 months the denim is too tight for the lower abdomen section.  I end up taking them off for something more comfortable immediately when I get home."
954,"Hi.  I wanted to get my grandsons each an Army outfit, cause Dad said they wanted  'army stuff""  (grandpa was an army retiree)  He was telling me exactly what to get.  What was army, and what wasnt.   When he saw these, he says  ""cool"" , when I told him the price, he says doubly cool!  I am proud to give these to my grandsons for Christmas. They are the real deal.  Thank you for helping to make my grandsons Christmas a little more wonderful. We will be back, for sure"
968,"These slippers are typical of Daniel Green products, beautiful, comfortable and affordable.
Thank"
983,"""I am an honest seller and I insure 100% satisfaction to my customers.  I can also ship out a better quality beanie visor hat for you. 
 
Please withdraw the feedback:"" -JTF Trading

Don't bother. I bought a better product from OldGlory. The feedback stays. People should know what they are buying. -Me

""Not a problem.  1 feedback doesn't hurt us at all because all of our other customers know about our products and our excellent customer service."" -JTF Trading

Well, I guess all I can do is you ""other customers"" know what a POS this hat was. That, and I had the hassle of this guy emailing me after I thought I made it clear that the matter was closed. 

Try OldGlory for a better deal and a better product"
1016,"My order arrived on time, the product was not as I expected. In my oppinion people shouldn't be allowed to use brand names like ""Ray-Ban"" if the product they sell is not that brand in particular. I guessed it by the price, but still, I thought, maybe was some crazy clearance, or who knows why. The package got here in excellent conditions. The seller offered a full refund, but I kept them to remind me of my mistake... So, the product's description is confusing and tricky... I am not happy with my purchase, but I hope I learned a lesson: ""nobody sells $100 bills for $20"""
1026,"To me a ""basic wool flannel trouser"" would be a more classic fit. The very low waist (NOT waist), 4"" zipper, too-long, and very wide cuff was an awful disappointment. I own 3 pr. Harve Benard from 4-5 years ago which fit me beautifully - same good tailoring, lined wool - so that's what I expected. I am 5'7"" and this year's design drags on the floor and sits down on my hips. The pant legs are 4"" wider than my old ones. Also missing here are the side elastic options"
1050,"I expected this bag to be much more comfortable ... but I have to constantly pull it back up on my shoulder just as often as other handbags. However, I do like all the compartments for organizing"
1053,"If you are a small frame person or a short person these will work fine for you. The white is thin and you can see through it so i don't reccomend buying white on this brand. The t-shirts run very small. A size x-large fits both of us very big on most brands but this brand was so tight we could not even get it on so these run very small. They are also short. 29 inches is short for a man's t-shirt. If you are tall, i would not recommend this t-shirt. 

The t-shirt is soft, not scratchy and the style is nice. We only had problems with the sizing and of course the white being so thin that it is see through"
1075,I didn't realize how big this bag really was until I received it. It makes a nice gift though
1115,I ordered this item one month ago and still haven't recived JACK!!!!
1127,"The Vibram soles leave black streaks all over the floors, and make it so I cannot wear them at work.  I love Rockports in general, and these are comfortable and well made as expected, but they leave a trail of scuff marks"
1129,The slipper seems to have some craftmenship. In my case they seem to run about a half size small. Who wants to wait for a pair of slippers to stretch? I wish I had known this in advance ... they look good in my closet though
1148,"I was able to track the progress of this item, and it took almost two weeks AFTER the order request hit the warehouse for for the item to be shipped.  I also paid for 2 Day shipping and once the item shipped it took 3 days to get to me"
1153,I like how smooth it is under t-shirts but the size is out. I ordered my usual 34B but found it too small. 34B fits in other brands so I know it's not because I've got bigger
1233,I did not expect the Jockey to not show any lines but there was absolutely no difference between these and a regular pair of bikini. These should be renamed Jockey Show-Everything Bikini
1276,"I bought a pair of these Calvin Klein hip briefs at a local retail store last year. I found this pair of underwear to be very tight and uncomfortable. I'm large up front and I found the crotch area to be quite small and thin. The pouch is also to small. I am a briefs man myself, but these are not as comfortable as most briefs. I can say though these briefs are good for wearing under low rise jeans. I would rather wear the Calvin Klein trunks or a pair of boxerbriefs instead of the hip briefs. The trunks are more comfortable for well endowed guys like me. If I had to choose only between these underwears or none at all, I would rather not wear any underwear at all"
1284,"where are larger sizes for big chested ladies, we exercise also!!"
1336,"I ordered this items in size xx-large for my 20 months doughter and there are huge. Maybe will fit when she will be 4 or 5, although she looks normaly for her age"
1373,"I was supposed to get it by no later than March 2, It is now March 19 and still no bag! I had read another review that said they waited a long time for this item, but I figured since I ordered it Febuary 15, to be sure it would be by now! What have they got working in their shipping department a couple of monkeys that only work two days a week"
1394,"I think that these shoes are very sassy, but I ran into one problem ordering them online...they aren't true to their size.  I always wear a 6 1/2 but after putting these on, my feet were asleep after about 10 minutes.  Order wisely"
1463,"This was TOO SMALL! The description says ""women's"" but there is NO way a woman will fit into this top. ""6th grade girl"" would be a better description. The price was great so I ordered a large but I usually wear a medium so I was shocked when it didn't even come close to fitting."
1465,I bought these at Target for my sons.  My six year old wore his two months until they fell apart.  Not too long in my opinion.
1480,"Nice looking boots - I got them in the mail yesterday.  I wear size 11 1/2 for every other brand and can sometimes comfortably wear a size 11, but these are waaayyyyy too tight.  I am going to need to send them back for a larger size.  I am going to try a size 12, but am afraid that they'll still be a little small"
