193,"This short is minimalistic. Just what you need if you are doing Yoga. Grips the leg, does not show what you do not what to show. I use black underpants under them, as they are a bit too minimalistic without. I think they are a bit overpriced, but I have not found as good a short for less (low demand?)"
282,"These were nice, lightweight budget jazz shoes; however, they do NOT fit the same as street shoes, despite what the description says. My daughter wears a 2.5 in street shoes, and I ordered her a 4 in the jazz bootie thinking there would be plenty of room for growth. WRONG! I have to return them and get her at least a 5 or maybe a 5.5. BEWARE"
417,"Bra was more padded than I thought when ordering.  Descriptions of products are not adequate.
thanks, though...love shopping on Amazo"
454,Lowest price I have found and they were just as advertised
487,"In response to Amazon asking for a review on these shorts, here it is. They're shorts. Not much more I can say about them. They are a little comfortable but nothing to write home about"
522,"The tshirt is great, my daughter loves it.  Unfortunately, it came 'dirty'.  Upon opening the package, we noticed a boot or shoe inprint on it, needless to say, we were very disappointed.  Now, how can they happen?  We called Customer Service and received a new shirt, but your shipping dept has someone who is willing to send an item like that--pretty sad."
525,"This product came quickly, contained all it described, high quality, however,  the picture representing the product was a bit misleading.  The color was different than depicted, and the belt clip did not match the skin.  I recommend looking at other similar PCWorld products to get an accurate idea of the colors"
631,"I choose 3-6 months size, but it looks like a 9 months size"
661,i wana order the leo desdin size 8 or 8.50 but it is not avalable since long time when it is gonna be avalable agin :
706,"but the bag is not very deep so doesn't hold as much as I was hoping...also, even empty, the zipper is very difficult to operate.  I wondered if security would be able to rezip it had they opened it"
742,"replacing an identical pair, now worn out - no reason to change a winning formula ;-"
855,"A picture did not show all the beauty design and the confort, I will buy more of this kind"
948,I ordered a men's size instead of women's twice and finally gave up.  It is not clear what size the crocs are although on the crocs it states mens/womens sizes.  If that had been included with the color choice I wouldn't have ordered the wrong size and would've kept the purchase
1046,"The item was what I expected however, It took them weeks to have the item shipped. I sent over emails to follow up and they never responded. Bad customer service."
1156,I like the wallet. The quality was good but the wood gift box was a big disappointment. I expected the box to be fully enclosed but it wasn't and the wallet fell out of it
1164,"A friend suggested these shoes for waltzing around the neighborhood. I will never forget that day.

The first thing you must know about these shoes is that they are horribly uncomfortable at first. With stiff plastic boards attached to your feet, you wander around wondering why you'd ever wasted your money. Soon, however, they start to mold to your feet. They take on every bone, every curve, every nitch. The next thing you know, it's like wearing a glove. Perfect shoes that seemed to be made just for you. As they age, they eventually start to smell, and you replace them and repeat the whole process.

I love these shoes. However, they do not love me. After years of wearing them, the lack of arch support finally did me in... I developed foot problems that rendered walking impossible for a few days. The pain lasted months. With time, and care, my feet are better. But I can't go back to these amazing shoes.

My suggestion is to wear them sparingly."
1258,"Dont buy it from Andrew Christian, i wrote them online several times and never, not once, got an answer from them, i ended up buying them some other place"
1314,"IF OTHER UNDERWARE BINDS YOU, YOU HAVE FINALLY FOUND ONE THAT DOESN'T. THE POUCH IS VERY LARGE, LOTS OF ROOM! I BOUGHT AN ADDITIONAL DOZEN AND THREW ALL MY OTHER BRANDS AWAY"
